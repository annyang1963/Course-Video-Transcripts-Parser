1,nd002,c1,l5,12 - ND331 C1 L5 A12 Implicit DAX - lang_en.srt,"00:03:23,570",something that well touch on as we move through filters in greater detail.
2,nd002,c1,l5,"10 - ND331 C1 L5 A10 Implicit Dax, Quick Measures And Filters - lang_en.srt","00:01:14,990",a little bit earlier is that the dimensions generally apply
3,nd002,c1,l5,11 - ND331 C1 L5 A11 Demo 2 - lang_en.srt,"00:01:04,910",something that well discuss a little bit later as we talk through the implicit measures.
4,nd002,c1,l5,14 - ND331 C1 L5 A13 Quick Measures - lang_en.srt,"00:00:02,475",quick measures are the next level of built-in calculations that you can
5,nd002,c1,l5,2 - ND331 C1 L5 A02 Demo 1 - lang_en.srt,"00:02:42,520",if i ever want to look at these again and see the details
6,nd002,c1,l5,5 - ND331 C1 L5 A05 One To Many - lang_en.srt,"00:01:32,240",all those good descriptive details can be listed just once and then
7,nd002,c1,l5,23 - ND331 C1 L5 A16 Lesson Review - lang_en.srt,"00:02:09,860",next lesson were going to learn how to build on this for those more unusual situations
8,nd002,c1,l2,10 - ND331 C1 L2 A10 Fact Tables Vs Dimension Tables- - lang_en.srt,"00:00:53,770",if we use the grocery store example from earlier
9,nd002,c1,l2,10 - ND331 C1 L2 A10 Fact Tables Vs Dimension Tables- - lang_en.srt,"00:00:19,770",consistent granularity or level of detail regarding their data.
10,nd002,c1,l2,10 - ND331 C1 L2 A10 Fact Tables Vs Dimension Tables- - lang_en.srt,"00:01:39,170",this is okay. fact table data is never experienced without the dimensional details.
11,nd002,c1,l2,9 - ND331 C1 L2 A09 Defining Key Columns - lang_en.srt,"00:00:12,965",for us to be able to use all the details on the product dimension.
12,nd002,c1,l2,2 - ND331 C1 L2 A02 Demo - lang_en.srt,"00:02:37,790",well go into this in greater detail later in the lesson

14,nd002,c1,l2,8 - ND331 C1 L2 A08 Dimensions - lang_en.srt,"00:02:01,985",i mentioned earlier that you want to have dimensions that are in plain
15,nd002,c1,l2,13 - ND331 C1 L2 A13 Data Source And Restructuring Possibilities - lang_en.srt,"00:01:31,225",this is where the suggestion i made earlier to
16,nd002,c1,l2,13 - ND331 C1 L2 A13 Data Source And Restructuring Possibilities - lang_en.srt,"00:01:01,345",next from where can we access the data?
17,nd002,c1,l2,13 - ND331 C1 L2 A13 Data Source And Restructuring Possibilities - lang_en.srt,"00:00:21,390",started building the intuition exercise.
18,nd002,c1,l2,11 - ND331 C1 L2 A11 Proving Uni-Table V. Data Model Efficiency With Vertipaq - lang_en.srt,"00:02:16,535",recall earlier was about 6.1 million and now were closer to about 5.5 million.
19,nd002,c1,l2,11 - ND331 C1 L2 A11 Proving Uni-Table V. Data Model Efficiency With Vertipaq - lang_en.srt,"00:05:07,850",we talked about earlier that beyond column size
20,nd002,c1,l2,11 - ND331 C1 L2 A11 Proving Uni-Table V. Data Model Efficiency With Vertipaq - lang_en.srt,"00:01:43,900",with all of those very interesting columns detailed out connected
21,nd002,c1,l3,6 - ND331 C1 L3 A06 Common Transformations- Columns - lang_en.srt,"00:01:24,600",if you find that you need to adjust a transformation that you made earlier on
22,nd002,c1,l3,6 - ND331 C1 L3 A06 Common Transformations- Columns - lang_en.srt,"00:00:49,940",which well get into during the next lesson.
23,nd002,c1,l3,6 - ND331 C1 L3 A06 Common Transformations- Columns - lang_en.srt,"00:01:32,570",something well talk about later in this lesson.
24,nd002,c1,l3,3 - ND331 C1 L3 A03 Power Query Basics Demo - lang_en.srt,"00:00:24,455",potentially even both will drive some of our next steps.
25,nd002,c1,l3,2 - ND331 C1 L3 A02 Power Query Basics - lang_en.srt,"00:00:00,000",like we discussed earlier
26,nd002,c1,l3,5 - ND331 C1 L3 A05 Tidying Up The Data - lang_en.srt,"00:01:06,485",for example tracking marketing projects or sales
27,nd002,c1,l3,14 - ND331 C1 L3 A14 Correct Your M Code - lang_en.srt,"00:02:36,360",next it will provide more specific coordinates for
28,nd002,c1,l3,14 - ND331 C1 L3 A14 Correct Your M Code - lang_en.srt,"00:03:01,195",then with the next step
29,nd002,c1,l3,14 - ND331 C1 L3 A14 Correct Your M Code - lang_en.srt,"00:03:56,495",next promoted headers was our first applied step here in green
30,nd002,c1,l3,14 - ND331 C1 L3 A14 Correct Your M Code - lang_en.srt,"00:01:47,345",it will navigate to the specific source details such as an excel spreadsheet tab.
31,nd002,c1,l3,7 - ND331 C1 L3 A07 Columns Demo 1 - lang_en.srt,"00:00:08,310",we just need a few columns to be available for a bigger corporate forecasting projection.
32,nd002,c1,l3,7 - ND331 C1 L3 A07 Columns Demo 1 - lang_en.srt,"00:00:00,000",lets go back to the sales leads data set that we reviewed earlier and demoed loading.
33,nd002,c1,l3,7 - ND331 C1 L3 A07 Columns Demo 1 - lang_en.srt,"00:00:19,575",for the purposes of this exercise
34,nd002,c1,l3,12 - ND331 C1 L3 A12 Data Types - lang_en.srt,"00:00:49,460",filter produce based on plu value ranges later on.
35,nd002,c1,l3,9 - ND331 C1 L3 A09 Rows Demo 2 - lang_en.srt,"00:00:03,315",with the opposite problem that we saw in the earlier demo.
36,nd002,c1,l3,9 - ND331 C1 L3 A09 Rows Demo 2 - lang_en.srt,"00:01:13,845",remember how i said earlier that this is tracking everything we do.
37,nd002,c1,l3,9 - ND331 C1 L3 A09 Rows Demo 2 - lang_en.srt,"00:00:50,910",the next thing we can try is removing them from the bottom.
38,nd002,c1,l3,4 - ND331 C1 L3 A04 Demo 2 - lang_en.srt,"00:03:24,995",previously it was looking for it in downloads
39,nd002,c1,l3,4 - ND331 C1 L3 A04 Demo 2 - lang_en.srt,"00:01:15,260",next i asked you to create a dedicated folder and move
40,nd002,c1,l3,4 - ND331 C1 L3 A04 Demo 2 - lang_en.srt,"00:03:58,115",and you can always use that to start your next exercise
41,nd002,c1,l3,4 - ND331 C1 L3 A04 Demo 2 - lang_en.srt,"00:04:10,280",if you forget how to make this fix later
42,nd002,c1,l3,4 - ND331 C1 L3 A04 Demo 2 - lang_en.srt,"00:02:06,950",but first is to read the details.
