Hi there. I'm Lenore Flower and I am here to Sherpa you through introduction to

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:10,695
preparing and modeling data with Power BI or as I like to think of it, data plumbing.

3
00:00:10,695 --> 00:00:13,335
Data modeling is a lot like plumbing.

4
00:00:13,335 --> 00:00:17,865
They're both about building the foundation for other key things to work well.

5
00:00:17,865 --> 00:00:20,475
In this course, we'll be learning how to

6
00:00:20,475 --> 00:00:23,864
connect up everything we need for a good data pipeline,

7
00:00:23,864 --> 00:00:25,740
and just like plumbing, none of

8
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,580
your reporting end users are going to know anything about it when it's working.

9
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,965
But they'll definitely notice when it's not.

10
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:37,220
I like to think of preparing and modeling as the unsung hero in Power BI

11
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:39,510
since it tends to get a little less attention than

12
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:42,455
its more glamorous data visualization layer.

13
00:00:42,455 --> 00:00:47,225
Don't get me wrong. Storytelling with data is awesome and absolutely important,

14
00:00:47,225 --> 00:00:49,895
but without all the plumbing and prep work underneath,

15
00:00:49,895 --> 00:00:52,135
none of those stories would be possible.

16
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:57,140
I was an early adopter of Power BI at my organization where at the time I

17
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,700
was looking for ways to better

18
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:02,240
present corporate reporting information as a financial analyst.

19
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,850
I quickly became fascinated with how you could mash

20
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:08,480
different data sources together and how learning just enough of some

21
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,050
of the key technologies such as Power Query and DAX could

22
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:16,360
set you up to create more complex and powerful analytics when you needed them.

23
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:21,050
As I continued to explore various data sources to enrich my analysis,

24
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:26,510
I realized that Power BI is broadly applicable beyond finance, and to my delight,

25
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:29,120
I also learned that the same technologies I use to

26
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,225
transform and model data in Power BI are

27
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:35,570
equally applicable to Excel and even scale up

28
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:38,915
to the enterprise level through Azure tabular data models,

29
00:01:38,915 --> 00:01:41,420
which is my primary focus today.

30
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:44,000
While our focus will be on Power BI,

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,300
a lot of the key concepts I'm going to teach you in this course will

32
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:51,470
also apply to many other data modeling tools.

33
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:55,684
I love that data modeling is scalable as well as flexible

34
00:01:55,684 --> 00:02:00,130
and it can be a lot of fun to collaborate with colleagues to solve their challenges.

35
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:03,410
At my day job managing enterprise-level data models,

36
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:06,290
I get to work with a pretty wide web of people to understand

37
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:09,380
what data is needed and how we can get the data plumbing

38
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,150
right to enable analysis of

39
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:17,205
seemingly unrelated information or make it difficult to compile reports automatic.

40
00:02:17,205 --> 00:02:21,475
Well, I'm not always in the limelight showing off dashboards at company meetings,

41
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:24,695
I find it incredibly rewarding to create the foundations for

42
00:02:24,695 --> 00:02:27,470
beautiful and efficient reports that my colleagues

43
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:30,515
know they can rely on for accurate information.

44
00:02:30,515 --> 00:02:35,870
Knowing the principles of data modeling also positions me to play superhero for

45
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,760
my colleagues when they get stuck on

46
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,510
a Power BI reporting problem and need a nudge in the right direction.

47
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:46,490
I'm excited to get you started working on preparing and modeling data in Power BI.

48
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:49,790
My goal is to give you a strong foundation in the key concepts,

49
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:51,860
many of which will allow you to not only use

50
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,740
Power BI more effectively but will also give you

51
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,380
the data modeling tools that you'll be able to apply in

52
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:00,965
tackling a huge range of different problems with confidence.

53
00:03:00,965 --> 00:03:06,810
Sometimes a little help from Google in your future role as data superhero and plumber.
