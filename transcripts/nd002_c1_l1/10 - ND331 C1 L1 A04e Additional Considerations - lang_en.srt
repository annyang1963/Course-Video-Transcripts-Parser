1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,950
Some additional considerations you'll need to keep in mind in all three cases.

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:06,855
First, security.

3
00:00:06,855 --> 00:00:08,925
Who should have access to what?

4
00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:12,270
This is important to discuss with stakeholders since

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:16,410
your data model can be used to access source data if you're not careful.

6
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,915
Second, data governance.

7
00:00:18,915 --> 00:00:22,080
Data governance formalizes how data is used

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,185
and maintained based on corporate level guidelines.

9
00:00:25,185 --> 00:00:29,070
They're generally in place for very good reasons to make sure that

10
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:33,570
the quality of data is good enough to support initiatives and decision-making.

11
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,215
Are there certain policies or approved datasets

12
00:00:37,215 --> 00:00:41,690
already in place at your organization that you can use or follow?

13
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:45,785
Speaking as someone who's on a Data Governance team currently,

14
00:00:45,785 --> 00:00:48,770
the people who maintain them will generally be very happy to

15
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:53,320
explain or clarify things with you to ensure consistent use of data.

16
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,455
Finally, are there any pre-existing data models,

17
00:00:57,455 --> 00:01:01,550
flows, or other sources you could use to create your report?

18
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:06,175
This course will walk you through how to create your own data models when you need them.

19
00:01:06,175 --> 00:01:10,880
But sometimes someone in your organization will have beaten you to the punch.

20
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,520
Powerbi.com lets you use and share data models and workspaces that you have access to.

21
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,500
That can save you time and provide

22
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:22,740
new opportunities to collaborate with colleagues or teams.
