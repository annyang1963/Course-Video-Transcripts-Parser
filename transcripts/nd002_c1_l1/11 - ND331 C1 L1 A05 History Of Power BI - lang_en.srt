1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,265
Like we discussed before,

2
00:00:02,265 --> 00:00:05,415
Power BI is really three tools layered together.

3
00:00:05,415 --> 00:00:07,110
You have Power Query,

4
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:11,775
get and transform data or what's often referred to as extract,

5
00:00:11,775 --> 00:00:15,780
transform, and load, the data modeling layer,

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,210
and then finally the report layer.

7
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,960
These three layers together are pretty great set of

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,650
tools that empower users to work with the data that they've got,

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,130
rather than the data they would ideally like to have.

10
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,520
Enabling users to leverage these kinds of tools is something that

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,745
Microsoft has been moving towards for the better part of a decade,

12
00:00:35,745 --> 00:00:39,910
though they were originally made available as separate technologies.

13
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:45,770
Let's talk briefly about how the technologies used in Power BI developed so that you

14
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:48,380
can better understand why it was created and

15
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:51,320
how it fits in with other tools in this area.

16
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,420
Starting back in 2005,

17
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,430
the vertipaq engine that drives

18
00:00:55,430 --> 00:01:00,220
Power BI calculations was first made available as part of MS SQL.

19
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:05,855
The vertipaq engine functions as a ad hoc in-memory database which is

20
00:01:05,855 --> 00:01:07,910
awfully useful when you're working on

21
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:11,690
a BI project and don't have a formal database to rely on.

22
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:15,140
But in 2010, the engine was then repurposed to

23
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:18,680
also serve as the guts of a new technology in the form

24
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,040
of Power Pivot and Power Query that

25
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,620
allowed Excel users to create data models with a simple atom.

26
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,265
A couple years later,

27
00:01:28,265 --> 00:01:32,540
a visualization layer called Power View became available in Excel.

28
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:38,150
This was the precursor to what subsequently became the reporting layer in Power BI.

29
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:41,870
These three segments Power Query, Power Pivot,

30
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:45,230
and Power View were then packaged together into

31
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:49,415
Power BI to create a single application that can extract,

32
00:01:49,415 --> 00:01:51,485
transform, and load the data,

33
00:01:51,485 --> 00:01:53,210
then model the data,

34
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:56,750
and finally produce interactive reports.

35
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:02,800
Power BI is constantly being improved and these improvements are crowdsourced.

36
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,960
This is one of the things I really love about the software.

37
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,840
There's a whole community that's grown up around it.

38
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,730
Here we can see a screenshot of

39
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:16,535
the Power BI Ideas website where Microsoft actively collects data from the community.

40
00:02:16,535 --> 00:02:21,095
In addition to lots of meetups and knowledge sharing among the users,

41
00:02:21,095 --> 00:02:24,830
the Power BI team is also always encouraging

42
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:29,225
feedback and suggestions to continue meeting end-users needs.

43
00:02:29,225 --> 00:02:31,640
They report out on these each month with

44
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:36,845
a monthly Power BI update on their YouTube channel so the tools are always improving.

45
00:02:36,845 --> 00:02:41,150
As we just saw, the technologies underlying Power BI were

46
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:45,650
originally developed and used in other parts of the Microsoft ecosystem.

47
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:48,260
That means many of the things you'll learn in this course

48
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,070
for Power BI can be applied elsewhere.

49
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:54,560
For example, here we see that Power BI shares a lot of

50
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,805
DNA with Excel and Azure tabular data modeling.

51
00:02:58,805 --> 00:03:01,760
Starting with Power Query and M Code,

52
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,220
these technologies are available in Excel's get data in

53
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:14,120
the tabular data modeling portion of Azure Analysis Services and in Power BI Desktop,

54
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,035
although their name's slightly different in Excel.

55
00:03:17,035 --> 00:03:23,160
Similarly, the M Code that supports all of these in Power Query is equally available.

56
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:27,700
With tabular data modeling, the vertipaq engine,

57
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:32,990
DAX formulas you use to calculate on top of the vertipaq engine,

58
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:37,550
and the relationships that create the sinew between different models in the data model

59
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:42,620
itself are also available in all three of these technologies.

60
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:49,880
Really the only area where functionally they're going to be very different is that you

61
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,280
can develop a report that you can load to

62
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:57,095
PowerBI.com off of Azure Analysis Services and Power BI Desktop.

63
00:03:57,095 --> 00:04:02,060
You can still use a Power Pivot Data Model in PowerBI.com,

64
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:05,010
but it's a little bit more complicated.
