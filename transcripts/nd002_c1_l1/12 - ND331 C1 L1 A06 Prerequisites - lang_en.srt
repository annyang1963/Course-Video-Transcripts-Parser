1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,205
If you're learning Power BI,

2
00:00:02,205 --> 00:00:05,774
you probably work in Excel quite a lot already,

3
00:00:05,774 --> 00:00:08,775
or maybe you have some familiarity with SQL.

4
00:00:08,775 --> 00:00:13,035
This training assumes no experience with Power BI or SQL,

5
00:00:13,035 --> 00:00:17,355
but it anticipates that you are comfortable with basic Excel functions,

6
00:00:17,355 --> 00:00:20,790
such as writing common formulas in Excel to perform

7
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:25,925
calculations such as SUM or Average, and creating tables.

8
00:00:25,925 --> 00:00:29,160
Familiarity with using pivot tables to analyze

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,265
data is also very helpful but not essential.

10
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:37,440
To be clear, it's not necessary for you to know SQL to succeed in this course.

11
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,630
But because SQL, M code,

12
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:43,200
and DAX are often just similar enough to trip you up,

13
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,220
I'll include some pointers throughout this course for those of you

14
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:49,660
who do have a SQL background to help you avoid getting stuck.

15
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:53,030
A good example that I run into whenever I'm not paying

16
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:57,640
attention is using double quotes instead of single ones in DAX formulas.

17
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,680
Provided you have the prerequisites I just mentioned,

18
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,780
you probably already know some data modeling before we even start.

19
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:09,200
A flat table, like the ones you've worked with in Excel is of simple data model.

20
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,085
So you already have some experience creating simple data models.

21
00:01:13,085 --> 00:01:16,100
If you're familiar with common Excel functions,

22
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,545
you actually already know some DAX.

23
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:25,765
Common examples of measures that are identical in Excel and DAX include: SUM, IF,

24
00:01:25,765 --> 00:01:30,060
MIN, MAX, AVERAGE, ABSOLUTE,

25
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,950
Round, and Today, although there are many others.
