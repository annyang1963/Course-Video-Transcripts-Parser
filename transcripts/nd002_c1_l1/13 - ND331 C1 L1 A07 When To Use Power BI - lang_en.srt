1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,250
We're going to spend the rest of this course on the details of how to use Power BI.

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,130
But first I want to spend a few minutes talking to you

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,535
about when you would use it, and more specifically,

4
00:00:11,535 --> 00:00:16,440
when would you use each of the three main components: Power Query,

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,310
data models, and Power BI reports?

6
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,940
So first, let's talk about Power Query.

7
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:28,830
Use Power Query when you need to pull data from multiple data sources,

8
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:33,015
and that can be either for a single report or

9
00:00:33,015 --> 00:00:38,515
for a data model that you want to generate multiple reports off of.

10
00:00:38,515 --> 00:00:44,840
When you want to change the table structure without changing the source.

11
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:50,430
When you want to set up auto-refreshes for data to keep it up to date.

12
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:56,680
Finally, whenever you need to get data in either Power BI or Excel.

13
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,855
Power Query isn't only used in Power BI,

14
00:00:59,855 --> 00:01:01,595
as we've discussed earlier.

15
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:04,520
This is the same as what you can find in

16
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:08,209
the get data feature in Excel if you've used it before,

17
00:01:08,209 --> 00:01:12,545
and can also be used to create a Data Flow and PowerBI.com.

18
00:01:12,545 --> 00:01:16,360
So others can access data you want to make it accessible.

19
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,695
The next layer of Power BI Desktop is the data model layer.

20
00:01:20,695 --> 00:01:23,540
Create a data model when you might otherwise

21
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:26,330
use a lookup function to merge data in Excel,

22
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:28,565
this might be VLookup,

23
00:01:28,565 --> 00:01:32,650
XLookup, index match, whatever your preferred flavor is.

24
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:37,070
This is where we would use dimension tables and relationships instead to make

25
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:43,090
this information available while minimizing any extra work for you or your computer.

26
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:46,280
When you have a range of calculations that you want to be

27
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,415
able to apply in different contexts or hierarchies.

28
00:01:49,415 --> 00:01:51,980
Say you want to be able to calculate gross profit

29
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:55,025
based not only on an individual time period,

30
00:01:55,025 --> 00:01:59,000
but also different products, departments, or stores.

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,845
In Excel, you may end up making dozens of calculations in individual cells.

32
00:02:03,845 --> 00:02:05,450
Where in Power BI,

33
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:10,080
you can use just one measure and repurpose it throughout your report.

34
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:16,655
Finally, when you can identify keys to support those relationships between data sources.

35
00:02:16,655 --> 00:02:19,655
To tie data together with relationships,

36
00:02:19,655 --> 00:02:23,630
you need a way to connect the data between those different tables.

37
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:27,155
Without this, you may have the need for a data model,

38
00:02:27,155 --> 00:02:29,870
but not the raw materials to make one.

39
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:32,975
Finally, onto the third layer,

40
00:02:32,975 --> 00:02:35,750
create a Power BI report.

41
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:40,040
When you want your reports' end users to really be able to dig

42
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:44,735
in and explore and analyze the data in a visually impactful way.

43
00:02:44,735 --> 00:02:47,240
When you might otherwise make a report with

44
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,940
different versions of the same tables on multiple pages,

45
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:55,670
and when you have access to a data set,

46
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:59,915
a data flow, or a data model to support your report.

47
00:02:59,915 --> 00:03:01,865
Like I mentioned earlier,

48
00:03:01,865 --> 00:03:05,840
we'll be going through each of these layers step-by-step throughout the course,

49
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,750
but with a heavy emphasis on the Power Query and

50
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:13,725
the data model layers that ultimately support every reporting layer.

51
00:03:13,725 --> 00:03:17,515
The reporting layers when I as a bias data plumber,

52
00:03:17,515 --> 00:03:19,680
tend to think of as the ooh,

53
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,540
shiny part of Power BI,

54
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:25,490
and it's not that the reporting layer isn't incredibly important.

55
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:28,310
Creating a good user interface and learning how to

56
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:31,685
story-tell with data is crucial and valuable stuff.

57
00:03:31,685 --> 00:03:33,050
I feel it tends to eclipse

58
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:37,295
the crucial foundation building that happens to make all that beauty possible.

59
00:03:37,295 --> 00:03:41,200
You don't need to remember all of these details right now.

60
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,590
But it's valuable for you to have a general awareness of where you might apply

61
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:51,845
these tools so that as you learn more about preparing and modeling data in Power BI,

62
00:03:51,845 --> 00:03:54,980
you're actively looking for opportunities to apply what

63
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:59,190
you learn in your own role as a Power BI professional.
