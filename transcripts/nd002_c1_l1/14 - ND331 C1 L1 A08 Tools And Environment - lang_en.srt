00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,595
When you're using Power BI,

2
00:00:02,595 --> 00:00:05,790
you really don't need more than a few things.

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,295
But we are going to make sure that we cover

4
00:00:08,295 --> 00:00:11,365
just a few of these before we jump in our next.

5
00:00:11,365 --> 00:00:13,799
First of all, you'll need your computer.

6
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:16,664
This is generally going to be a Windows computer.

7
00:00:21,648 --> 00:00:26,238
Secondly, you'll need the latest version of Power BI Desktop.

8
00:00:26,238 --> 00:00:29,028
Power BI Desktop is freely available from

9
00:00:29,028 --> 00:00:34,138
PowerBI.com and the link is readily available below as well.

10
00:00:34,268 --> 00:00:37,583
You will require DAX Studio,

11
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:44,108
which is a open source tool that really augments the analysis that we can do

12
00:00:44,108 --> 00:00:47,168
in terms of how your data model is
