00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,220
Let's briefly recap.

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:06,900
Power BI is an industry leader in business intelligence software in

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,795
no small part because the software is actually

4
00:00:09,795 --> 00:00:13,365
three components in one: the Power Query layer,

5
00:00:13,365 --> 00:00:15,730
which we use to extract, transform,

6
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:19,110
and load from a variety of data sources,

7
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:20,895
the Data Modeling layer,

8
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:24,630
where we build relationships between your data tables,

9
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,280
and the Reporting layer,

10
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:30,030
which we use to present the end-user with the data in a format they

11
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:34,485
can easily use to explore and better understand their data.

12
00:00:34,485 --> 00:00:38,895
Versions of every one of these tools have been in Excel in the past.

13
00:00:38,895 --> 00:00:41,685
Two of the three, Power Query and Power Pivot,

14
00:00:41,685 --> 00:00:44,690
remain powerful tools you can use in Excel with

15
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:48,785
the same skills you'll be learning in this course for Power BI.

16
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:56,355
we need to take time to plan.

17
00:00:56,355 --> 00:00:59,505
That planning has two main components.

18
00:00:59,505 --> 00:01:01,735
First, collaboration.

19
00:01:01,735 --> 00:01:06,854
Power BI models and reports are only as good as the inputs you have available,

20
00:01:06,854 --> 00:01:10,485
both in terms of data sets and subject matter knowledge.

21
00:01:10,485 --> 00:01:13,185
I'll be providing some tips on how you can work with

22
00:01:13,185 --> 00:01:16,545
colleagues to make sure you can get the data right and how

23
00:01:16,545 --> 00:01:19,395
you can go about making some of the more challenging judgment

24
00:01:19,395 --> 00:01:23,015
calls when it comes to cleaning up or augmenting your data.

25
00:01:23,015 --> 00:01:27,495
Finally, sketching your model is critical if

26
00:01:27,495 --> 00:01:31,800
you want to be able to avoid putting all your energy into building the wrong thing.

27
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,505
We'll get some practice with this soon as well.

28
00:01:34,505 --> 00:01:36,495
Throughout this course, will get

29
00:01:36,495 --> 00:01:40,740
hands-on practice with all of the steps we've talked about in this lesson.

30
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,455
Being a data partner may not sound too glorious,

31
00:01:43,455 --> 00:01:46,185
but the work you can do once you know how to prepare

32
00:01:46,185 --> 00:01:49,220
and model your data, it's incredibly rewarding.
