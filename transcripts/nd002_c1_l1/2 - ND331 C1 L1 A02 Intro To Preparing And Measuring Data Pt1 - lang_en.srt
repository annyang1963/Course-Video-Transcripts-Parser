1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,380
Imagine the head of your company comes into your office really

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:08,400
excited about this new report her friend showed her from a different organization.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,750
This other CEO has been bragging about how he can track inventory, sales,

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,580
and profitability on his phone,

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,975
and how he has all this key information now in the palm of his hand.

6
00:00:18,975 --> 00:00:23,520
Now that the big boss at your company knows this is possible, she wants one too.

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,440
Really who can blame her?

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,940
Being able to visually analyze your data in one place is the dream.

9
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:33,090
A good visualization is a powerful way to facilitate

10
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,320
smart decision-making and identify potential issues early on.

11
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,575
There's just one teensy tiny problem.

12
00:00:40,575 --> 00:00:45,095
The reality is your company's data is all over the place.

13
00:00:45,095 --> 00:00:47,765
As a budding business intelligence professional,

14
00:00:47,765 --> 00:00:49,430
you know that your company,

15
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:54,100
like most companies, has relatively low data analytics maturity.

16
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,730
The data has to be pulled from a whole bunch of different locations and sources with

17
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:04,150
formats ranging from Hadoop to SQL to Excel, even PDF files.

18
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:06,935
Some companies solve this problem by using

19
00:01:06,935 --> 00:01:11,450
a centralized data warehouse to merge data from different teams.

20
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:14,255
But if you're working at a smaller company,

21
00:01:14,255 --> 00:01:18,200
it may not be an option to have some fancy centralized data warehouse where

22
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,910
all this key information is reliably stored and consistently structured.

23
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:26,930
To be able to create a report like the owner has in mind,

24
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:30,200
you're going to need to take data from each department,

25
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,205
like marketing with their Facebook and Salesforce data,

26
00:01:34,205 --> 00:01:37,160
finance with their many Excel spreadsheets.

27
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:41,135
IT with their SQL database and research and development,

28
00:01:41,135 --> 00:01:44,270
who for some reason are storing things in PDFs,

29
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:48,410
and funnel all of this data together for the report.

30
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:51,950
Somehow, you're going to need to mash up

31
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:55,070
all these different data sources, funnel them together,

32
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:59,990
and somehow do some cleanup where the data quality leaves something to be desired,

33
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:02,845
and finally, create a report.

34
00:02:02,845 --> 00:02:06,380
How on earth are you going to tame this mess of data sources and

35
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:10,285
get them all working in harmony to meet your boss's needs?

36
00:02:10,285 --> 00:02:14,960
That, my friends, is where preparing and modeling data comes to the rescue.

37
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:20,289
From my perspective, it's where the Power BI software is at its best.

38
00:02:20,289 --> 00:02:26,030
With Power BI, we'll see that we can handle a huge variety of data sources.

39
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:30,350
Then it provides us with an inexpensive yet effective option so

40
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,670
that we don't need to spend money on

41
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:34,850
a costly solution like a sophisticated data warehouse,

42
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:36,245
let alone the time.

43
00:02:36,245 --> 00:02:40,160
Power BI is a powerful tool that will allow you to effectively

44
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,880
prepare and model your data regardless of your company's size.
