00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,715
As I alluded to during the introduction,

2
00:00:02,715 --> 00:00:07,230
Power BI is much more than a data visualization tool and is capable of

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:09,810
mushing together all those disparate data sources

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,630
we need to combine to keep the big boss happy.

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,990
Let's look at the Power BI pipeline in more detail.

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,920
First, we need to access the data sources that have been

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,635
identified that have the core information necessary for the CEO's desire of report.

8
00:00:25,635 --> 00:00:28,350
From there, we use Power Query to connect to

9
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:33,090
those data sources and load and transform them as necessary.

10
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:38,090
Queries are the intermediary stage where you perform ETL or extract,

11
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:40,670
transform and load steps onto

12
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:42,770
your source data to morph it into

13
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:45,790
the shape that you need for your data model to perform well.

14
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:48,740
When you save and apply these queries in Power BI,

15
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,430
they become tables in the data model layer.

16
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:55,270
Note that each query points to a corresponding data table,

17
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:58,790
this is meant to reflect that data and transformations that

18
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:02,480
occur in Power Query align to the data in each of these tables.

19
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,870
Additionally, each of these three tables are connected by

20
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:10,300
relationships which are symbolized by the black lines connecting the tables.

21
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,955
These relationships tell the Power BI software that the data is

22
00:01:13,955 --> 00:01:18,500
interrelated and allows calculations to flow between the tables,

23
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,855
something that we'll discuss in greater detail

24
00:01:20,855 --> 00:01:23,540
during the relationship segment of this course.

25
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:28,910
Finally, we can use all of this data to generate a Power BI report,

26
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:31,640
this reporting layer reflects the output of

27
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,895
your data model in a visual and user friendly manner.

28
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:36,740
We'll touch on the reporting layer,

29
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:41,185
but the meat of this course will really focus on layers 1 and 2;

30
00:01:41,185 --> 00:01:43,910
the Power Query layer and the data model layer.

31
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:46,295
But before we even start on this pipeline,

32
00:01:46,295 --> 00:01:49,025
it's important to understand that we don't want to just

33
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:52,280
jump straight into getting and modeling data.

34
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:56,645
First, we need to spend some time figuring out

35
00:01:56,645 --> 00:02:01,235
what information we need to create the queries and build up the data model.

36
00:02:01,235 --> 00:02:05,560
Put it simply, first we plan or we plan to fail.

37
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,665
We need to take the time to learn what the final report should include,

38
00:02:09,665 --> 00:02:13,555
where the data is and if we can access or rely on it.

39
00:02:13,555 --> 00:02:18,530
If we rush into getting and modeling our data without first having this understanding,

40
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:22,460
we may create a pipeline that doesn't meet the needs of the end users,

41
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:25,690
and that's when people will notice the bad plumbing.

42
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:29,065
This planning usually goes in two main parts.

43
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:33,470
First, the data modeling usually starts with a conversation.

44
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,465
The answer is pretty low tech,

45
00:02:35,465 --> 00:02:39,430
talking it through with folks that know the source data best.

46
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:44,660
In my experience, this often involves a small group meeting and a big whiteboard.

47
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:48,365
Then you create your plan for your data model based on what you learned,

48
00:02:48,365 --> 00:02:51,995
which in my experience usually starts with a sketch.

49
00:02:51,995 --> 00:02:54,860
The road map you make for yourself needs to be

50
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:58,070
informed by key information like the format

51
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:00,140
of the data sources and the kinds of

52
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:04,770
relationships you need to create between your data tables.
