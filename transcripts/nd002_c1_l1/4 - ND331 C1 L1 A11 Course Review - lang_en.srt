1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
Here's a look at what we'll be covering in this course.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,235
We'll start with an introduction,

3
00:00:05,235 --> 00:00:08,610
where I will try to sell you on the joy of data plumbing,

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:11,025
one of my very favorite topics.

5
00:00:11,025 --> 00:00:12,855
We'll go through some main tools.

6
00:00:12,855 --> 00:00:16,080
These are what I like to think of as the Power BI sandwich,

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,850
where you have Power Query,

8
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,605
where you load the data,

9
00:00:19,605 --> 00:00:23,565
you've got the data modeling layer where you make relationships.

10
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:26,340
Then of course there's a reporting layer on top,

11
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:31,530
where you make all the beautiful visualizations that you know and love.

12
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:35,060
We'll get into a little bit greater depth with

13
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:38,750
that Power BI data pipeline from soup to nuts,

14
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:43,885
where we'll talk about how those different pieces come together and align.

15
00:00:43,885 --> 00:00:47,250
Then we'll go into key concepts.

16
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:52,430
This is really where we get into the designing and structuring of a data model,

17
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:55,130
which is an important prerequisite before you

18
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:58,615
get into the technology and start moving things around.

19
00:00:58,615 --> 00:01:01,580
We'll start with data model components,

20
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:04,070
which will be fact tables,

21
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:07,160
dimension tables, relationships, and keys.

22
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,070
Different pieces that you're going to need to connect

23
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:14,335
together so that your data will perform the way you want it to.

24
00:01:14,335 --> 00:01:20,075
We'll talk about the hows and whys of data modeling and transforming the data,

25
00:01:20,075 --> 00:01:25,325
so you'll have a better sense before we jump into using Power BI and Power Query,

26
00:01:25,325 --> 00:01:29,900
what we're trying to accomplish and what the underlying goals are,

27
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:33,400
that we'll be using this technology to make happen.

28
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,100
Then we'll take our first step in using Power Query.

29
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,754
We'll be getting data and we'll explore

30
00:01:39,754 --> 00:01:46,205
not only the Power Query basics of how you use power Query to pull in information,

31
00:01:46,205 --> 00:01:50,555
but also all the different options that you have when it comes to Power Query.

32
00:01:50,555 --> 00:01:54,565
You'll find that there's a lot of different ways that you can access data.

33
00:01:54,565 --> 00:01:58,245
We'll also go through Common Data transformations.

34
00:01:58,245 --> 00:02:02,375
Once you have that data pulled into Power Query from various sources,

35
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:04,610
how do you make it organized and

36
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:08,030
structured in a way that will align with Power Queries needs,

37
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:11,960
so you can understand what the data is and so that you can

38
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,020
understand where to find it and what each of

39
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:18,665
those things are when you pull it into the data model layer.

40
00:02:18,665 --> 00:02:21,605
Finally, we'll talk about data types.

41
00:02:21,605 --> 00:02:24,140
This is a really important concept because it

42
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:27,260
impacts everything from how filters are applied,

43
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:32,155
to how the data is able to be presented at the reporting level.

44
00:02:32,155 --> 00:02:35,310
Next, we'll get into bigger transformations.

45
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:38,075
I have to say this is my favorite lesson.

46
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:40,910
It's where we really get to put our wizard hats on and

47
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,700
do some really magical things with the data.

48
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,745
We'll start with addressing errors and gaps in the data.

49
00:02:46,745 --> 00:02:50,930
This is the cleaning of data that often needs to happen to make sure

50
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:55,260
that information aligns exactly with how the report needs to work,

51
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:01,310
while also taking care to ensure that the potential corrections that you make

52
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:03,980
aren't over-cleaning the data or causing

53
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:07,955
the information to be misleading at the reporting layer.

54
00:03:07,955 --> 00:03:11,540
Then we'll talk about transformations across queries.

55
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:15,380
This is where beyond just the basics of structuring your data,

56
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,779
you can mush the data together,

57
00:03:17,779 --> 00:03:21,005
or what I like to think of as stapling it from

58
00:03:21,005 --> 00:03:25,385
one to the other so that everything is aligned the way you need it to.

59
00:03:25,385 --> 00:03:28,910
You can also do cool things like unpivoting

60
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:32,780
the data and organizing your data in new ways,

61
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:36,310
splitting the data so that you have it the way that you need it.

62
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:39,455
What I like to think of as transfiguration.

63
00:03:39,455 --> 00:03:43,015
We'll talk about creating date tables as well.

64
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:45,885
Then we'll go into creating date tables.

65
00:03:45,885 --> 00:03:47,870
You'll find as we go through this process,

66
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,465
that date tables are a really important part

67
00:03:50,465 --> 00:03:53,405
of the overall data model that you'll be building.

68
00:03:53,405 --> 00:03:59,120
Specifically because this enables things like time intelligence to be used,

69
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,105
and to ensure that the date structure

70
00:04:02,105 --> 00:04:06,035
that's used within your table aligns with your needs.

71
00:04:06,035 --> 00:04:09,655
Next, we'll go into relationships and DAX.

72
00:04:09,655 --> 00:04:14,630
Relationships are a really important part of the overall data model.

73
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:18,230
I like to think of them as creating the sinew of the data model.

74
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:21,530
The filters determine which direction that

75
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:26,770
the relationships carry key information related to the dimensions.

76
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:30,950
We'll talk about how DAX uses those relationships.

77
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:34,010
DAX is data analytics expressions,

78
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:39,320
and it's important calculations that we'll use within our reports and data models.

79
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:44,705
Then we'll get into reporting and even more DAX in our final lesson.

80
00:04:44,705 --> 00:04:47,345
This will include other schemas,

81
00:04:47,345 --> 00:04:51,080
situations where a standard star schema

82
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,930
doesn't really work the way that we would need it to.

83
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:59,134
For example, when we have more than one fact table,

84
00:04:59,134 --> 00:05:02,150
or we need to include more than one date table,

85
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:05,420
or even a disconnected table to allow for

86
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:09,445
parameters and additional reporting considerations.

87
00:05:09,445 --> 00:05:14,075
We'll talk about basic reporting on that final reporting layer.

88
00:05:14,075 --> 00:05:18,815
We'll include tables, but also matrices.

89
00:05:18,815 --> 00:05:23,090
We'll have cards, and we'll include a little bit about how to use

90
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:28,700
textboxes to enable you to add additional information to your report.

91
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:32,000
We'll talk about common DAX for reports,

92
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,010
building on the prior lesson.

93
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:37,460
These are things like if and switch

94
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:42,460
statements that you can use to add some nuance and depth to your reporting.

95
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:48,500
Finally, we'll go through troubleshooting for every layer of the Power BI sandwich.

96
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:53,285
This will allow us to ensure that you have tidied up information

97
00:05:53,285 --> 00:05:58,435
as well as the most efficient data model and report possible,

98
00:05:58,435 --> 00:06:02,640
based on everything that we've learned so far in this course.
