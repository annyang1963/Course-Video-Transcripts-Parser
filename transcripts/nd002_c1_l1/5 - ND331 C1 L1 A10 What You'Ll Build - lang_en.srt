1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,385
In the project at the end of this course,

2
00:00:02,385 --> 00:00:05,640
you'll have the opportunity to demonstrate what you have

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,749
learned by creating a data model and Power BI report.

4
00:00:09,749 --> 00:00:15,060
This will combine the major data preparation and modeling concepts taught in this course,

5
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,730
such as cleaning up and transforming data from

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:22,155
multiple data sources to solve a common problem in the real world.

7
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:26,435
Data Silo is getting in the way of effective decision-making.

8
00:00:26,435 --> 00:00:28,020
Let me set the scene.

9
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:31,340
You're a junior BI developer who has just been hired by

10
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:34,895
Seven Sages Brewing Company up near Seattle, Washington.

11
00:00:34,895 --> 00:00:37,080
Seven Sages has a common problem,

12
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:41,570
they have a lot of data that is not centrally located and they

13
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,790
need help getting everything organized so

14
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:46,625
they can understand their corporate profitability.

15
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:49,760
They know that their main flagship beer,

16
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,530
the Bamboo Grove Maibock,

17
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:53,285
is the most popular,

18
00:00:53,285 --> 00:00:55,370
but it's unclear otherwise,

19
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:59,750
how much is being sold and what is ultimately the most profitable,

20
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:03,570
and if some are perhaps even losing money.

21
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:07,565
There's one more wrinkle with this.

22
00:01:07,565 --> 00:01:12,290
The Seven Sages brewing company is located in Washington state,

23
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:16,070
but they also sell their beers in British Columbia.

24
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:19,930
So there's a currency exchange consideration as well,

25
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:22,430
and they have a fiscal calendar.

26
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:24,455
So for their data model,

27
00:01:24,455 --> 00:01:27,695
they need to have a fiscal calendar as well as

28
00:01:27,695 --> 00:01:32,075
a standard calendar incorporated into their date table.

29
00:01:32,075 --> 00:01:37,445
We'll go over all the steps you'll need to take to make your data model.

30
00:01:37,445 --> 00:01:39,650
Which in my experience always starts

31
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:43,295
with really getting a firm understanding of the data,

32
00:01:43,295 --> 00:01:47,210
and as a newer business intelligence professional,

33
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:51,200
learning how to organize your data into fact,

34
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,275
dimension tables, key columns,

35
00:01:54,275 --> 00:01:57,055
and date tables as well.

36
00:01:57,055 --> 00:02:00,800
We'll also go through a pipeline of how you take

37
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,280
information starting from the initial source,

38
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,830
from a variety of different options.

39
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:10,670
Pull the information into queries and Power Query so

40
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:15,095
that you can perform what we call Extract, Transform, and Load.

41
00:02:15,095 --> 00:02:20,750
Then take that information once it's been restructured so that you can organize

42
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:26,850
it into a data model and ultimately generate the Power BI report that you need.

43
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:31,400
I designed this project with several of the challenges I've seen

44
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,045
colleagues stumble over or that I've stumbled over myself.

45
00:02:35,045 --> 00:02:36,830
When you're finished with this project,

46
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:38,735
you'll have demonstrated the ability to create

47
00:02:38,735 --> 00:02:44,570
a highly functional data model that can generate insights by customers and products,

48
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:50,640
that incorporates currency rates and which accounts for both fiscal and calendar years.
