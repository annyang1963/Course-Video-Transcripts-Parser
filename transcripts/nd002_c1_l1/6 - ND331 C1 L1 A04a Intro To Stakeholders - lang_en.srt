00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,240
In this video, I want to talk about the stakeholders,

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,550
in other words, who you'll be working with.

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,820
Because creating a Power BI data model and

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,260
the subsequent reports is as much about people as it is about data.

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:19,050
Who your stakeholders will be will depend on your organization size and structure,

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,915
and their stage of Power BI adoption.

7
00:00:21,915 --> 00:00:25,440
It also depends on the size of your data modeling team.

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:31,020
How many people will be engaged in data modeling and reporting in report building,

9
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:36,020
which can be anything from a one-person job to a massive team effort.

10
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,580
I've sketched out a few common scenarios,

11
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:42,160
though yours will probably fall somewhere in the middle.
