1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,930
The first one I'd like to talk about is the lone ranger.

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:08,520
This is where you are an early adopter of Power BI,

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,670
and possibly the only one at your organization.

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:16,860
In this situation, your stakeholders will be your report consumers,

5
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,995
which might be clients, company leadership,

6
00:00:19,995 --> 00:00:23,985
or simply your team if the work you do is heavily data-driven.

7
00:00:23,985 --> 00:00:28,215
Your allies need to be anyone who holds the keys to data.

8
00:00:28,215 --> 00:00:30,555
That might be someone in IT, for example,

9
00:00:30,555 --> 00:00:33,450
who knows where to find the data available through SQL,

10
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,095
Access databases, SharePoint lists, etc.

11
00:00:37,095 --> 00:00:40,075
This is someone you want to be friend, bring donuts to,

12
00:00:40,075 --> 00:00:43,730
generally maintain a strong mutual positive relationship with,

13
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:45,215
they can help you a lot.

14
00:00:45,215 --> 00:00:47,630
Your key to the data kingdom in my experience,

15
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,095
is the phrase read-only access.

16
00:00:50,095 --> 00:00:53,630
The person who controls access to the data might be rightly

17
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:56,960
concerned about limiting those who can edit and intentionally,

18
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,360
or unintentionally, corrupt the data.

19
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,150
So you're far more likely to get access to

20
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:05,330
the data if you make it clear that you only need to read,

21
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:07,140
not write the data.

22
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,135
Your key challenge might be getting the foundation right without

23
00:01:11,135 --> 00:01:16,535
an in-house mentor or team to help you troubleshoot in Power BI when you get stuck.

24
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:18,020
As an early adopter,

25
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,930
you are probably passionate about what could be

26
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:24,140
and how this technology can drive improvements in your own work,

27
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:26,405
your team, maybe the company as a whole.

28
00:01:26,405 --> 00:01:30,410
All that said, this is one of those times when you need to go slow,

29
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:32,345
so you can go fast later on.

30
00:01:32,345 --> 00:01:35,270
Focus on getting those key principles right first,

31
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:39,515
so you don't shoot yourself in the foot down the line as your data model scale.

32
00:01:39,515 --> 00:01:43,010
On the flip side, your key opportunity is to make

33
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:48,110
those positive impact interactive data analytic tools so that Power BI can

34
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:53,600
have that positive impact on decision-making and comprehension of large data-sets,

35
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,640
potentially across your entire company.
