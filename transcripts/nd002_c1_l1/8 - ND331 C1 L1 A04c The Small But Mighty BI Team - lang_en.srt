1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,850
The next scenario I'd like to discuss is,

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:04,920
the "Small But Mighty" BI Team.

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,980
This is when you're a part of a small group that knows how to use

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,445
Power BI well and creates tools that others can use.

5
00:00:11,445 --> 00:00:15,405
But they're targeted to eliminate subject area with the focus

6
00:00:15,405 --> 00:00:19,455
limited to specific areas like sales or finance.

7
00:00:19,455 --> 00:00:21,135
In this sort of situation,

8
00:00:21,135 --> 00:00:22,860
your stakeholders fall into

9
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:27,765
that specific area that your company chooses to focus their analysis on.

10
00:00:27,765 --> 00:00:32,310
Your key allies are the business process owners or BPOs,

11
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:34,230
who know their data and needs.

12
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:38,570
Your key challenges might be translating the business needs.

13
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:42,050
In other words, getting those business process owners to clearly

14
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:46,630
define and describe those needs in a way that you can translate into our port.

15
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:52,360
This is where phrases like explain it to me logically step-by-step come in handy.

16
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,550
You may also run into data quality issues.

17
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:59,330
Sometimes, unfortunately, you'll be in a position where you'll have to gently

18
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:03,725
explain to folks that data doesn't exist in a way that will support their needs,

19
00:01:03,725 --> 00:01:07,835
or that it's impossible to do some calculation or analysis

20
00:01:07,835 --> 00:01:12,260
given data quality issues that need to be resolved at the source first.

21
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:13,835
You may have heard the phrase;

22
00:01:13,835 --> 00:01:15,715
garbage in, garbage out.

23
00:01:15,715 --> 00:01:17,780
The same rule really applies here,

24
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,030
but maybe use a gentler phrase if we're

25
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:22,910
talking to someone who helps to generate that data.

26
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:26,300
Your key opportunity might be to de-silo the data,

27
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,660
showing how seemingly unrelated data from other areas of

28
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:33,475
the organization can enhance analysis and decision-making.

29
00:01:33,475 --> 00:01:36,560
De-siloing data can be a powerful way to

30
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,680
gather new insights that can empower decision-making.

31
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,625
As long as you can find the data and the joins to connect them,

32
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:47,550
you have all the tools you need to make that happen.
