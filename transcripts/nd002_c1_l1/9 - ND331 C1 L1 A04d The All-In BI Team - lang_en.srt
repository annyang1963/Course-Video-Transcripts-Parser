1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The final scenario all the way at

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,525
the other end of the spectrum is an All-In BI enterprise.

3
00:00:06,525 --> 00:00:11,040
This is where your organization openly values data because of

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,140
the impact it can have on decision-making and invests in enterprise-level tools.

5
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:20,430
Either it has already created them or it's in the process of doing so.

6
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:23,550
Organizations can centralize power BI report development

7
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,770
into one or more dedicated teams,

8
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:30,625
or there can be distributed networks of those who use Power BI throughout the company.

9
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:34,415
Not unlike how almost everyone uses Excel from time to time,

10
00:00:34,415 --> 00:00:36,785
even if they're not in accounting or finance,

11
00:00:36,785 --> 00:00:40,470
your stakeholders could be anyone with a vested interest in reporting.

12
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,275
From a sales lead to the CEO,

13
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:45,035
your key allies will similarly run the gambit,

14
00:00:45,035 --> 00:00:47,745
but the keys need still apply.

15
00:00:47,745 --> 00:00:51,980
You need people to help you identify and access reliable data source,

16
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:56,689
and you need people to help you understand what the data is telling you,

17
00:00:56,689 --> 00:00:59,460
and what it means for decision-making.
