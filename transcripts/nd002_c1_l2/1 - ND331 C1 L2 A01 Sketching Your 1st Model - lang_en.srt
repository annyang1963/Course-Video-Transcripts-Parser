00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
As we discussed in the introductory lesson,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,230
the first step when creating a data model is to plan, meaning,

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:12,585
that we need to understand the underlying requirements and the available data sources.

4
00:00:12,585 --> 00:00:18,025
What do we need to create the desired reports and where can we access this data?

5
00:00:18,025 --> 00:00:21,420
Does it even exist somewhere in the first place?

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,365
There are a lot of different ways that data can be organized successfully,

7
00:00:25,365 --> 00:00:28,335
but it's very important that you have a good sense of

8
00:00:28,335 --> 00:00:31,425
what you're building before you start to try to build it.

9
00:00:31,425 --> 00:00:33,650
Going back to the plumber analogy,

10
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:37,580
it won't do to start building out a bathroom only to find out that

11
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:41,490
the sink is planned out where the client requires a bidet.

12
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,190
So in a work environment,

13
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:47,540
this would be the fact-gathering stage where we'd be meeting with colleagues to

14
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:52,310
talk through the reporting needs and requirements usually with a big whiteboard nearby.

15
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,695
Then with the team's needs in mind,

16
00:00:54,695 --> 00:00:59,150
we sketch out how the data available might fit together to meet this need.

17
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:04,190
This sketching itself is a key skill to have when preparing and modeling data,

18
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:06,015
not the actual drawing itself.

19
00:01:06,015 --> 00:01:10,145
You don't need to be an artist to do this and your sketches don't need to look pretty.

20
00:01:10,145 --> 00:01:11,645
Mine certainly do not.

21
00:01:11,645 --> 00:01:14,690
The key goal here is simply to think through

22
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:19,265
the data pipeline first before you jump into building something.

23
00:01:19,265 --> 00:01:23,345
This is meant to help you conceptualize how the data will look and connect,

24
00:01:23,345 --> 00:01:27,980
including identifying the columns you do or don't need from your different sources.

25
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:31,850
The way I draw a table for example tends to just look like this,

26
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:36,810
with a few column headers at the top and squiggles to represent the data.
