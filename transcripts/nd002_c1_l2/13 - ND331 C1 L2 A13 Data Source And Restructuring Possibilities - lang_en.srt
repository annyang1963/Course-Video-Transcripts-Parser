1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,605
Now that you've got

2
00:00:01,605 --> 00:00:05,740
a solid foundation of the different components that will make up our data model,

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:08,070
let's talk about gathering your data sources with

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,835
colleagues and then discuss how you can think through the restructuring.

5
00:00:11,835 --> 00:00:14,820
We've already talked through how important it is to get

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,795
feedback from subject matter experts when planning a report.

7
00:00:18,795 --> 00:00:21,390
Let's get back to that meeting I took without you when we

8
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,880
started building the intuition exercise.

9
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,385
Some of the questions that I would have asked,

10
00:00:26,385 --> 00:00:29,280
and that you should too in future meetings like this,

11
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,955
are meant to help us define the structure of the data model.

12
00:00:32,955 --> 00:00:36,870
Things like what key data needs to be calculated in

13
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:41,380
the report helps us know what the facts are that we should include in our fact table.

14
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,680
How is the data grouped or filtered?

15
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,490
This gives us a clue in terms of what kind of dimensions that we need,

16
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:50,630
and if perhaps we need to work with them to create

17
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:55,260
our own groupings on the dimension table to facilitate special reporting needs.

18
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,065
The data can support,

19
00:00:57,065 --> 00:01:01,345
but we'll need a little bit of additional logic to make possible.

20
00:01:01,345 --> 00:01:04,920
Next, from where can we access the data?

21
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,305
This will help us to find our data sources,

22
00:01:07,305 --> 00:01:10,070
and it will also ensure that we're not trying to build

23
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,750
something where there isn't a data source available.

24
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:16,170
Do we need access rights?

25
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,970
This is an often forgotten but critical question to ask.

26
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:26,150
For example, a SQL database connection string might be something you can get easily,

27
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:31,225
but it doesn't do you any good if you can't also obtain the appropriate permissions.

28
00:01:31,225 --> 00:01:34,835
This is where the suggestion I made earlier to

29
00:01:34,835 --> 00:01:39,230
ask for read only access can often be helpful in obtaining this.

30
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:45,035
Is there any sensitive data that we need to take care not to pull into the data model?

31
00:01:45,035 --> 00:01:48,350
Security settings are outside the scope of this course,

32
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:51,650
but one way you can avoid needing to address them in the first place,

33
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:53,810
is to take care to avoid pulling in

34
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:58,230
any fields to your data model that contains sensitive information.

35
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:01,995
Finally, can we rely on the data?

36
00:02:01,995 --> 00:02:06,320
If your subject matter experts are telling you that you can access the data from

37
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,060
somewhere but they don't trust it all the way to be reliable information,

38
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:14,500
this may not be the right time for this report to be made.

39
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,795
However, if the situation is that there are certain

40
00:02:17,795 --> 00:02:22,880
known consistent errors that can be addressed holistically in the data set,

41
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:28,495
this is something we can do in Power Query and that we'll cover in an upcoming video.

42
00:02:28,495 --> 00:02:30,545
In an ideal scenario,

43
00:02:30,545 --> 00:02:32,600
you'll leave this kind of meeting with a list of

44
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,860
sources and a sense of what's available in each.

45
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:40,955
From there, you would review these sources to confirm they will all work in Power BI,

46
00:02:40,955 --> 00:02:44,810
and then start thinking through you can transform it into what you need.

47
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:47,450
Luckily, there are a wide range of sources that

48
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:50,375
have custom connections already in Power BI,

49
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:54,875
and there are additional ways you can enable connections if for whatever reason,

50
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:57,370
what you need isn't readily available.

51
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:00,410
Power Query also gives you plenty of options for how we can

52
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:03,935
adjust information without impacting the source data itself.

53
00:03:03,935 --> 00:03:09,125
You're certainly not locked in to the initial structure just because it's how it arrived.

54
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:13,555
There are many ways to transform data to get it how you need it to be.

55
00:03:13,555 --> 00:03:16,280
If you can logically explain how you'd want the data

56
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,115
to change based on how it exists currently,

57
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:22,655
and if those changes can be applied across an entire column,

58
00:03:22,655 --> 00:03:26,850
you're generally going to be able to make those changes using Power Query.

59
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,825
Despite all this freedom,

60
00:03:28,825 --> 00:03:32,050
there are a few things you can't do.

61
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:37,120
One, you can't reference just one cell in Power Query or

62
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,800
Power BI in general because cells aren't really a thing in this technology.

63
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,650
When a transformation occurs,

64
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:48,755
it's generally across values in an entire column in the table.

65
00:03:48,755 --> 00:03:53,860
Two, you can't create a report with data that doesn't exist.

66
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,990
I refer to this as vapor data.

67
00:03:55,990 --> 00:04:01,870
Often folks just assume that data that would be useful must exist somewhere.

68
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,400
The reality, of course,

69
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,765
is that data doesn't exist unless someone took the time to track and maintain it.

70
00:04:07,765 --> 00:04:11,045
Unfortunately, potentially useful data

71
00:04:11,045 --> 00:04:15,080
often isn't tracked until someone decides that they want some kind of report on it.

72
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,670
It can be a bit of a catch-22.
