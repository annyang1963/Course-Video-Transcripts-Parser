1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,190
In this lesson, we'll focused on getting

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:05,160
your brain engaged in the planning portion of creating

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:10,500
a Power BI data model in anticipation of developing your data model and reports.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,010
My big takeaway for you is yes to unicorns,

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:18,270
yes to UniBrowse, no to Uni-tables.

6
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:23,400
In this lesson, we learned about the core components of a data model structure.

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,480
First, we talked about the wrong way to model your data with Uni-tables.

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,910
This is where we mash everything together and create

9
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,480
one giant very inefficient table, no Bueno.

10
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,185
Then we talked about the main components of a data model.

11
00:00:37,185 --> 00:00:39,570
In particular, fact tables,

12
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:44,599
dimension tables, keys, and relationships between our tables.

13
00:00:44,599 --> 00:00:48,380
We saw that one of the key takeaways in this lesson is that

14
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:52,100
by separating our data into fact tables and dimension tables,

15
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,605
then using relationships to connect them,

16
00:00:54,605 --> 00:00:59,510
we can create much more efficient and useful data models.

17
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:04,010
Planning the tables and relationships in your data model is critical.

18
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:06,800
We learned that one of the ways that we can do this is with

19
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,700
a simple sketch of a data model before we start building anything,

20
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,610
which becomes our roadmap.

21
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:14,795
We considered at a high level,

22
00:01:14,795 --> 00:01:16,865
how we can restructure source data,

23
00:01:16,865 --> 00:01:19,670
logically shifting or transforming datasets to

24
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:22,850
meet needs of a data model and the resulting report,

25
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:26,450
including options to merge one source

26
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:30,205
of data with another or rework the columns and rows represented.

27
00:01:30,205 --> 00:01:33,620
We used the VertiPaq Analyzer in DAX Studio to

28
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:36,950
make some of these key best-practices complete,

29
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:41,510
including that deleting one fact table column can

30
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:46,280
make significantly more impact than 13 dimension columns individually.

31
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,860
Now that we've gotten some practice thinking through

32
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,720
some basic data models and planning them out,

33
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:58,080
we're ready to get some hands-on practice with getting data in Power BI, Power Query.
