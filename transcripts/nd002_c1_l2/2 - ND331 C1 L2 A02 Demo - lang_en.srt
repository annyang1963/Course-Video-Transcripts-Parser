1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
I thought we best start with a demo in Power BI where I

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,345
can introduce these concepts a bit more concretely.

3
00:00:06,345 --> 00:00:09,720
That way, when we're going through these in the abstract,

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,675
you'll have something specific to associate them with.

5
00:00:12,675 --> 00:00:16,050
Now to begin, it's important to understand that in Power BI,

6
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:20,655
data sources once selected and get data become queries,

7
00:00:20,655 --> 00:00:25,050
and once loaded and are transferred in Power Query become tables.

8
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:30,370
Let's take a brief peek at the data in Power Query first.

9
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:36,965
I can show you very briefly using the produce query that

10
00:00:36,965 --> 00:00:41,840
I've already taken several applied steps on the right to clean up the data a bit.

11
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,770
What I really want you to focus on here is the three query names here;

12
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:50,659
produce, sales, and store calendar.

13
00:00:50,659 --> 00:00:59,280
They're all the same as what we just saw here on the reporting pane: produce,

14
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,395
sales, store calendar,

15
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:06,765
and they'll repeat when we look at the data pane which is here.

16
00:01:06,765 --> 00:01:09,530
Produce, sales, store calendar,

17
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:13,955
same information but represented as tables rather than queries,

18
00:01:13,955 --> 00:01:18,510
and then reflected again in the data modeling pane.

19
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,415
If you've seen a Power BI presentation in the past,

20
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:25,220
you may have seen that the visual is generally interact.

21
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,480
But here we have

22
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,760
three different data sources on

23
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,835
the right-hand side of the reporting pane as we looked at before,

24
00:01:31,835 --> 00:01:34,610
and it's obvious they're not interacting as they should.

25
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:37,840
Normally, if I select items on this Treemap,

26
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,995
say if I select herbs,

27
00:01:39,995 --> 00:01:42,950
this card showing the subtotal of sales would

28
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:46,130
give me just the subtotal sum of sales for herbs.

29
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:52,370
Instead, it's showing our sub-total sales for all products with no change,

30
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:55,495
and that remains true no matter what I select.

31
00:01:55,495 --> 00:01:58,115
There's something else odd here as well.

32
00:01:58,115 --> 00:02:03,020
Treemaps are a little like square pie charts if you're not familiar with them.

33
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,690
The area they take up represents their share of

34
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:08,980
a value and in this case, that's also subtotal.

35
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:14,000
You would generally expect to see different sizes of boxes representing how much

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,465
of each product type makes up the total subtotal for those sales.

37
00:02:19,465 --> 00:02:24,050
Of course, the reason nothing in this report is working is because we're referencing

38
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,970
data from three different tables and I've

39
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:28,655
deliberately avoided setting up the relationship.

40
00:02:28,655 --> 00:02:31,880
Let's go back to the model pane and fix that.

41
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,865
Here in the middle is my fact table.

42
00:02:34,865 --> 00:02:37,790
This includes all of my sales transactions.

43
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,625
We'll go into this in greater detail later in the lesson,

44
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:44,050
but the fact table holds facts or things that happen.

45
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:46,534
If you look at this table up close,

46
00:02:46,534 --> 00:02:52,100
you can imagine a grocery store clerk ringing up each of your purchases one by one.

47
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:56,060
Each of these would become its own row in a table like this one.

48
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,400
Now let's go back to the diagram.

49
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,340
Do you see that there's a PLU column listed right there on the sales table,

50
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,630
and then if we go over to the produce table,

51
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:08,720
there is a corresponding PLU column here as well?

52
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,544
Once we tie these two PLU columns together,

53
00:03:12,544 --> 00:03:14,555
we create a relationship,

54
00:03:14,555 --> 00:03:17,965
because both of these are what we call key columns.

55
00:03:17,965 --> 00:03:22,595
Now all of the additional descriptive information that's available on

56
00:03:22,595 --> 00:03:25,430
the produce dimension table is available to provide

57
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:28,460
additional details about those sales transactions,

58
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:31,945
and we'll do the same thing for our store calendar.

59
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:36,740
Date column, which is our key column for the stock calendar.

60
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:42,110
Date column on the sales fact table are now tied together.

61
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:45,985
We have two relationships for our three tables.

62
00:03:45,985 --> 00:03:48,154
If we go back to the report,

63
00:03:48,154 --> 00:03:52,970
we're now able to use all that useful information from the dimension tables to

64
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:58,170
augment the fact tables and that's reflected in the Treemap here.

65
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:01,655
You can see that the relationships are feeding in and working.

66
00:04:01,655 --> 00:04:05,030
If we select the herb section of the Treemap,

67
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,875
you can see in the subtotal right here,

68
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:12,365
we're getting a true subtotal for herbs rather than the total for everything.

69
00:04:12,365 --> 00:04:15,920
You can do that with fruits and vegetables as well.

70
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,860
We're now seeing a proportion of subtotal of

71
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:22,295
sales by produce of category just as we wanted.

72
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:26,749
We'll get into data clean up in upcoming lessons but for now,

73
00:04:26,749 --> 00:04:28,640
we're going to focus on nailing down

74
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:32,250
the foundational concepts of fact tables, dimension tables,

75
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:36,170
and keys so that when you've got your own datasets all cleaned up,

76
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:40,140
creating your own connections will be just as quick and easy.
