1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,895
This lesson's major focus is on key concepts in data modeling.

2
00:00:04,895 --> 00:00:08,850
We'll be talking about some new terms like fact tables,

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,640
dimension tables and keys.

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,700
But before we get into all of this,

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,875
I'm sure some of you are wondering,

6
00:00:16,875 --> 00:00:20,100
why are we tackling data modeling before we

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,785
even start loading datasets or creating our queries.

8
00:00:23,785 --> 00:00:26,025
If you're, give yourself a gold star,

9
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:28,290
It's an excellent question.

10
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:31,755
We named this lesson key concepts and data modeling,

11
00:00:31,755 --> 00:00:35,940
but we could have just as easily called it prep work for Power Query.

12
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,360
When we're looking at our pipeline with the queries feeding into tables,

13
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:44,300
it would be easy to conclude that we should start by building out

14
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:49,100
the queries that we will pull into the source data and feed it into the tables.

15
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:53,210
You might think that these queries are simply the source data as is,

16
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:58,375
and that this will define what will be made available in the data model.

17
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:02,510
That might be true in terms of how the pipeline runs.

18
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:06,005
But in terms of how you think about and plan your pipeline,

19
00:01:06,005 --> 00:01:08,210
it's really the other way around.

20
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:12,830
You should first think about what the data model and report needs to look like,

21
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:16,190
and only then write the queries that pull

22
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:20,400
the data you need and support that foundational build.

23
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,015
As a budding data model there,

24
00:01:23,015 --> 00:01:27,230
I want you to get into the habit of beginning with an end in mind.

25
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:31,550
I recommend you sketch out your data model using the raw materials you

26
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:35,795
have each time you're preparing to develop a report,

27
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:38,870
even before you open the Power BI software.

28
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,520
If you don't do this,

29
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,955
you risk a very time-consuming cycle of guessing,

30
00:01:43,955 --> 00:01:46,820
checking, and correcting your queries.

31
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:49,235
While you can't loop back to change queries

32
00:01:49,235 --> 00:01:52,085
whenever you run into issues in the data model,

33
00:01:52,085 --> 00:01:55,595
and this is certainly something you will still run into time to time.

34
00:01:55,595 --> 00:01:58,100
Even if your initial design was perfect,

35
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:03,320
such as when data changes or reports requirements change,

36
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,890
you'll still find this process a lot faster and much less

37
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:11,735
confusing if this rework is the exception rather than the rule.

38
00:02:11,735 --> 00:02:15,245
With that potential source of confusion out of the way,

39
00:02:15,245 --> 00:02:18,490
let's look at what we'll cover in this lesson.

40
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:24,040
In this lesson, we'll delve into the core components of data model structure.

41
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:29,570
First, we'll talk about the wrong way to model your data with unit tables.

42
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:33,545
This is where we mash everything together and create one giant,

43
00:02:33,545 --> 00:02:35,930
very inefficient data table.

44
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:39,710
Then we'll talk about the main components of a data model.

45
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:42,499
In particular, fact tables,

46
00:02:42,499 --> 00:02:48,275
which are tables that store our aggregatable or additive data, dimension tables,

47
00:02:48,275 --> 00:02:51,695
which store our descriptive data, keys,

48
00:02:51,695 --> 00:02:57,170
which provide values that we can use to create relationships between our tables.

49
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:01,010
We'll see that one of the key takeaways in this lesson is

50
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:04,880
that by separating our data into fact tables and dimension tables,

51
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,505
and then using relationships to connect them.

52
00:03:07,505 --> 00:03:10,960
We can create much more efficient data models.

53
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:15,035
Planning the tables and relationships in your model is critical.

54
00:03:15,035 --> 00:03:17,240
We'll look at how to make a simple sketch of

55
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,435
a data model before we start building anything.

56
00:03:20,435 --> 00:03:25,010
We'll consider from a high level how we can restructure the source data.

57
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:27,950
Logically shifting or transforming datasets to

58
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:31,255
meet the needs of a data model and the resulting report.

59
00:03:31,255 --> 00:03:36,650
Some examples of this might include merging data from one source to another,

60
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,600
or reworking how columns and rows are

61
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:42,185
represented in your query to meet the desired end result.

62
00:03:42,185 --> 00:03:46,400
Finally, we'll check out how we can use the VertiPaq analyzer and

63
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,995
DAX Studio to make some of these key best practices more concrete.

64
00:03:50,995 --> 00:03:56,120
In general, the stage we're focusing on here is one part getting your head on

65
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:00,950
straight and one part planning how you will communicate to the Power Query software,

66
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,975
what it is you want to accomplish.

67
00:04:02,975 --> 00:04:06,410
In this lesson, we'll learn how to do both of those things,

68
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:09,035
so that when we go to create our pipeline,

69
00:04:09,035 --> 00:04:11,790
we know exactly what we're building.
