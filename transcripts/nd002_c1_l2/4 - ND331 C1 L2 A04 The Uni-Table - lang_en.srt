00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,090
To better understand the components of a data model,

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:06,680
let's first talk about what not to do when creating your data model.

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,820
I call this the uni-table.

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,785
If you're coming from an Excel background,

5
00:00:10,785 --> 00:00:14,790
your first instinct when modeling data is probably going to be to

6
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:19,950
create an extremely wide table with all the aggregatable fields,

7
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:22,965
and all of the descriptive fields mushed together.

8
00:00:22,965 --> 00:00:27,930
For example, here, amount is an aggregatable field,

9
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:33,660
we could aggregate the amount by getting a sum of the total number of apples sold,

10
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,805
which in this example would be two.

11
00:00:35,805 --> 00:00:39,915
In contrast, variety is a descriptive field,

12
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:42,240
we can't add Gala and Fuji,

13
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,620
rather, these fields help us describe the other data.

14
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:49,945
For example, they allow us to know that of the two apples sold,

15
00:00:49,945 --> 00:00:52,935
one was a Gala and one was a Fuji.

16
00:00:52,935 --> 00:00:58,220
It's likely that your data didn't all come as a single big table like this.

17
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:01,085
But instead, you piece together your mega table using

18
00:01:01,085 --> 00:01:06,860
one or more look-ups so that all the values you would need would be on the relevant rows.

19
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,555
In a small dataset,

20
00:01:08,555 --> 00:01:09,995
you can get away with this,

21
00:01:09,995 --> 00:01:12,830
but as the dataset grows over time,

22
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:15,690
it will become impossible to manage.

23
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:20,359
Having everything in a single uni-table is inefficient.

24
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:23,540
Again, what we mean by everything is that you've got

25
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:28,135
both your aggregatable and descriptive data in the same table.

26
00:01:28,135 --> 00:01:31,595
This can work okay for small amounts of data,

27
00:01:31,595 --> 00:01:36,500
but it gets increasingly efficient as the data grows.

28
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:41,570
I learned this the hard way during the first few months I was using Power BI,

29
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:44,120
my report could handle a month or two of data,

30
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:48,680
but it started to wheeze and freeze once I added several years of data.

31
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,640
I ran to IT thinking my computer was broken, where in fact,

32
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,650
I was just being very inefficient with the tools I had available.

33
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:01,535
What's the problem? Why do we lose efficiency

34
00:02:01,535 --> 00:02:05,465
when we have our descriptive and aggregatable fields all mushed together.

35
00:02:05,465 --> 00:02:07,970
The problem is repeat data.

36
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:11,990
Your goal when creating a data model is really just to minimize

37
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:17,220
that repeat data and make the structure of it as efficient as possible.

38
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:21,230
If we go back to our example,

39
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:24,275
we can see that we have multiple purchases that

40
00:02:24,275 --> 00:02:27,290
all have the exact same descriptive information.

41
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:31,880
For instance, here are Fuji apples with the same PLU code.

42
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:37,640
This is because all of these rows are for sales where customers bought the same product.

43
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,534
Or if we look at the dates,

44
00:02:40,534 --> 00:02:44,375
we can see that a lot of these sales happen on only two dates,

45
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:47,825
which all have the exact same data for month and year.

46
00:02:47,825 --> 00:02:50,480
This is a lot of repeat data in our model.

47
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,220
As the dataset grows,

48
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,840
this is only going to get worse.
