1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,530
How do we minimize the repeat data in our model?

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:08,160
We can accomplish this goal by keeping transactions and

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,620
descriptions of transactions in separate tables connected by relationships.

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,000
In this example, rather than having one big unit table,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,965
we could divide it into three separate tables.

6
00:00:22,965 --> 00:00:26,279
Now that the data is in separate tables,

7
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:30,150
we can take out all of the repeat descriptive data,

8
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:31,830
like all the duplicate rows,

9
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:33,945
let's say Fuji and Gala,

10
00:00:33,945 --> 00:00:38,895
or all of the rows that have duplicate dates and remove it.

11
00:00:38,895 --> 00:00:41,820
But now we run into a new problem.

12
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,030
If we look at one of our sales,

13
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,820
we have the amount sold and the cost.

14
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:50,005
But how do we know what type of product was sold,

15
00:00:50,005 --> 00:00:51,350
or for that matter,

16
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:54,920
how do we know what month or year the product was sold in?

17
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,135
We need some way of linking the data in these tables.

18
00:00:59,135 --> 00:01:03,790
We can do this by having a unique value that is shared between the tables.

19
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:05,540
To identify the product,

20
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:08,285
we can add the unique PLU column to

21
00:01:08,285 --> 00:01:11,525
both the sales table and the descriptive produce table.

22
00:01:11,525 --> 00:01:14,540
Since the PLU is now in both of these tables,

23
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:20,075
it allows us to create a relationship connecting the descriptive and aggregatable data.

24
00:01:20,075 --> 00:01:22,555
This is called a key.

25
00:01:22,555 --> 00:01:27,440
A key is a column of unique values that is shared between tables.

26
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,285
With the PLU as key,

27
00:01:29,285 --> 00:01:32,240
we can now see that these two transactions which have

28
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,234
the same PLU of 4132 were both Gala apples.

29
00:01:37,234 --> 00:01:42,665
Similarly, if we want to be able to get information about the transactions,

30
00:01:42,665 --> 00:01:46,085
we can add the date column to our sales table.

31
00:01:46,085 --> 00:01:51,935
This serves as a unique key as well and allows us to connect with the date table.

32
00:01:51,935 --> 00:01:53,975
So now, for example,

33
00:01:53,975 --> 00:01:59,460
we can easily find out that all of these transactions took place in February.
