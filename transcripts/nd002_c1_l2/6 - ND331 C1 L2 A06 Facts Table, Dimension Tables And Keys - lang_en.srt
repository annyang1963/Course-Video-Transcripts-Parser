1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
The key takeaway from the example we just went through is that we want

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:10,095
to split our aggregatable data and our descriptive data into separate tables.

3
00:00:10,095 --> 00:00:13,530
This allows us to remove the duplicate data,

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:18,420
and then use the keys to create relationships between the tables.

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,650
All of this allows us to greatly reduce the amount of

6
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:27,180
repeat data and thus improve the efficiency of our data model.

7
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,845
There is some specific vocabulary that goes along with this.

8
00:00:31,845 --> 00:00:34,560
The tables that hold our descriptive data,

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,585
we call dimension tables.

10
00:00:36,585 --> 00:00:39,555
The tables that hold our aggregatable data,

11
00:00:39,555 --> 00:00:42,045
we call fact tables.

12
00:00:42,045 --> 00:00:47,225
Let's talk about the key characteristics of dimension tables and fact tables.

13
00:00:47,225 --> 00:00:50,315
Dimension tables store descriptive data,

14
00:00:50,315 --> 00:00:54,695
like data describing that a particular product is

15
00:00:54,695 --> 00:00:57,860
a specific variety of apple or that

16
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:01,875
a particular date occurred in the month of February and so on.

17
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:04,790
Dimension tables tend to be short and fat.

18
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:08,720
The reason they tend to be fat is because we often need a lot of

19
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,985
columns to provide all the descriptive information we need.

20
00:01:12,985 --> 00:01:16,160
We may want to say that a product is a fruit.

21
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,020
That is an apple,

22
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:21,215
that it is a specific variety of data.

23
00:01:21,215 --> 00:01:24,395
We may want to give the product size and so on.

24
00:01:24,395 --> 00:01:30,500
The table can get very wide or fat with all the descriptive columns added.

25
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,385
But we don't repeat that descriptive data.

26
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:36,530
That's why the dimension tables tend to be short.

27
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:41,060
We only need a single row to describe each unique item.

28
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:46,640
In contrast, fact tables are used to store aggregatable data.

29
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,410
They tend to be long and thin.

30
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:52,115
For example, with a sales data,

31
00:01:52,115 --> 00:01:54,770
we can have many transactions in which

32
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:58,205
different customers purchase the same type of apple.

33
00:01:58,205 --> 00:02:03,604
The fact table for sales data will get longer and longer as we make more sales.

34
00:02:03,604 --> 00:02:06,920
With both dimension tables and fact tables,

35
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,035
we need to have a key.

36
00:02:09,035 --> 00:02:13,820
This is how we create a relationship linking the two tables so that we can

37
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:19,100
do things like looking up all the sales that meet a particular product description.

38
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:24,410
Fact tables and dimension tables are a core concept in data modeling.

39
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:28,980
We'll get lots of practice working with them as we go through this course.
