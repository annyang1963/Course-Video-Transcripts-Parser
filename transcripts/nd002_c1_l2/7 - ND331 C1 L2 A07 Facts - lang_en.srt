1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,859
When we talk about facts,

2
00:00:01,859 --> 00:00:07,155
we're referring to events that can be measured and quantified.

3
00:00:07,155 --> 00:00:12,630
They generally provide a numerical answer to what or how much.

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:17,880
Stuff like what is the average number of hours worked in January?

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,665
Or how much has Store 110 sold year to date?

6
00:00:22,665 --> 00:00:28,604
Imagine being in a grocery store checkout and scanning each individual product.

7
00:00:28,604 --> 00:00:32,745
Every beep of the scanner would signify a new fact and a new row

8
00:00:32,745 --> 00:00:37,320
being created in a grocery store's fact table of sales transactions.

9
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,600
Facts come in several flavors.

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,310
They can be additive, semi-additive, or non-additive.

11
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,845
Let's review them one by one.

12
00:00:46,845 --> 00:00:53,090
Additive facts mean that each individual fact can be logically measured

13
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:54,995
using the descriptive data from

14
00:00:54,995 --> 00:00:59,135
any dimension and that they will logically work for your reporting.

15
00:00:59,135 --> 00:01:00,590
These are most facts.

16
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:03,620
They're things like quantity,

17
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:09,135
sales, invoice amounts, hours worked. You get the picture.

18
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:11,265
It's stuff you add up.

19
00:01:11,265 --> 00:01:14,480
Semi-additive facts are a little bit different.

20
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:19,130
They can be calculated with some dimensions but not others.

21
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:23,335
Some examples that came to mind are inventory counts.

22
00:01:23,335 --> 00:01:28,400
For example, you can add up inventory counts across stores, but not days.

23
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,680
Bank account balances.

24
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,575
If you think of your own bank account balance, for example,

25
00:01:33,575 --> 00:01:37,730
you wouldn't add up yesterday's balance to today's and expect that

26
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:42,515
that total opening balance for tomorrow be the sum of both.

27
00:01:42,515 --> 00:01:45,035
Though, of course, that would be very nice.

28
00:01:45,035 --> 00:01:47,930
The same is true for accounts receivable

29
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:53,220
balances and other organizational balances such as accounts payable.

30
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,210
Really any other fact that represents

31
00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:00,575
some cumulative snapshot is going to fall into this category.

32
00:02:00,575 --> 00:02:05,150
Most common examples of semi-additive facts are values

33
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:10,025
that have some daily balance that can't be added up over the course of time.

34
00:02:10,025 --> 00:02:13,535
Although I'm sure there are exceptions to this rule.

35
00:02:13,535 --> 00:02:16,550
On to non-additive facts.

36
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:21,200
Non-additive facts are facts you need for reporting or calculations,

37
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,950
but you don't want to be add up.

38
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:28,940
A few examples are percentage discounts,

39
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,880
unit prices, or profit margin.

40
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:36,305
These are all instances where you might want the numbers to calculate sales

41
00:02:36,305 --> 00:02:40,850
or profit or some other key performance indicator.

42
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:43,615
But you wouldn't want to sum them together.

43
00:02:43,615 --> 00:02:47,570
It wouldn't make any sense for you to sum up all your percentage discounts,

44
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:52,100
for example, and get 5,260 percent.

45
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:57,920
Keep an eye out for non-additive facts that may sit better in a dimension table.

46
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,720
If a unit price is tagged to a specific item and unlikely to change,

47
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,600
you may be better off keeping that tracked and

48
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,140
maintained in a product dimension than on your fact table.

49
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:13,625
This is one of those judgment calls that depends on a variety of factors.

50
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:17,790
But it's good to keep in mind as an option if you need it.
