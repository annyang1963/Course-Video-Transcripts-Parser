1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,620
Onto dimensions.

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:06,105
Dimensions are the things that we use to describe our facts.

3
00:00:06,105 --> 00:00:10,080
I really like Ralph Campbell's description of them as the who, what,

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,570
when, where, how, and why associated with the event or fact.

5
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,360
These descriptive components are used in reports to group,

6
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,735
summarize, and filter data.

7
00:00:21,735 --> 00:00:25,730
If you're not sure what fields you want to include in your dimensions,

8
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:30,200
a good trick is to talk through what different ways you'd want

9
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:35,075
to slice and dice your data for reporting and look for by phrases.

10
00:00:35,075 --> 00:00:43,170
If, for example, your boss says she wants to see all sales by fruit type, fiscal quarter,

11
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,870
and regional store location,

12
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:50,510
this can help you identify the fields that she will be looking for,

13
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:53,120
and that you'll want to ensure that you include on

14
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,905
the relevant dimensions so they're available for your report.

15
00:00:56,905 --> 00:00:59,030
In the grocery store example,

16
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,924
you can imagine that there's a wealth of information

17
00:01:01,924 --> 00:01:05,735
about the products being purchased on the product dimension.

18
00:01:05,735 --> 00:01:07,625
This will be your what.

19
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:13,810
The timing of when the purchases were made on the date dimension, this is your when.

20
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:18,724
Which store a customer bought those items in on the store dimension,

21
00:01:18,724 --> 00:01:21,110
which would serve as your where.

22
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:26,300
Some information on you via your loyalty card on the customer dimension,

23
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,680
which would be your who.

24
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,515
If we look at the sales transaction fact table,

25
00:01:32,515 --> 00:01:37,569
your customer ID might be associated with many individual sales over

26
00:01:37,569 --> 00:01:43,020
time at your local grocery store with your customer ID listed for each one.

27
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,225
But you and your customer ID number would

28
00:01:46,225 --> 00:01:49,645
only show up once in the customer dimension table.

29
00:01:49,645 --> 00:01:52,165
This makes it easy for us to reference

30
00:01:52,165 --> 00:01:55,690
additional customer information about you and associate it with

31
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:58,450
those purchases when we need it while still

32
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:01,985
keeping the transactional data trim on the fact table.

33
00:02:01,985 --> 00:02:06,445
I mentioned earlier that you want to have dimensions that are in plain

34
00:02:06,445 --> 00:02:10,840
English rather than obscure acronyms or number codes.

35
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's look at a concrete example.

36
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:16,310
Here on the left hand of the slide,

37
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:21,535
we have loyalty tiers for the same customer dimension that we looked at a moment ago.

38
00:02:21,535 --> 00:02:25,969
As you can see, this tier grouping is being used to calculate

39
00:02:25,969 --> 00:02:31,235
an average of monthly purchases for customers that fall into those categories.

40
00:02:31,235 --> 00:02:34,400
At the bottom, you can see that the loyalty tier becomes

41
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,605
the ledger name for each of these groups' individualization.

42
00:02:38,605 --> 00:02:41,630
Both the dimensions column name and

43
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:46,295
the dimensional data within the column tend to show up on the report itself.

44
00:02:46,295 --> 00:02:51,450
It's best to make sure they are both unambiguous and easy to read.
