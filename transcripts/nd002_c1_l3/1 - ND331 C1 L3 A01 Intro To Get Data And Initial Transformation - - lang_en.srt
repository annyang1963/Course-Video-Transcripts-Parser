1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,220
Now that we've dispelled the idea that you should just make a big unit table,

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:09,300
and we've gotten familiar with fact tables and dimension tables,

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,815
it's time to learn how to load and transform our data with Power Query.

4
00:00:13,815 --> 00:00:16,410
Recall from our Power BI pipeline that this

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,005
is our starting layer that we'll use to create

6
00:00:19,005 --> 00:00:24,390
a data model before generating that user-friendly visual report layer.

7
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,035
In this lesson, we'll focus on Power Query.

8
00:00:28,035 --> 00:00:32,730
Let's zoom in a bit on this part of the process.

9
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:36,560
First, of course, we need to access the data,

10
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,800
and we'll learn how to do this using the Get Data feature.

11
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,710
Let's take a look together at the options you have at

12
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:46,250
your fingertips to pull together data from Power BI and discuss

13
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,340
some creative approaches you can take if Power BI doesn't

14
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:53,675
already have a ready connection for what you need out of the box.

15
00:00:53,675 --> 00:00:56,975
Power BI supports a huge range of data sources.

16
00:00:56,975 --> 00:01:00,170
We'll learn about some of these in this lesson as well as where to

17
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:04,025
go to see what additional data sources are available.

18
00:01:04,025 --> 00:01:08,720
Next, we'll learn how to tidy up the data to make it easy for you,

19
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:14,300
your end users, and Power BI itself to easily find and use the data you need.

20
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,210
The initial data we get from a query

21
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:20,795
before we've tidied it up can have a whole bunch of issues.

22
00:01:20,795 --> 00:01:23,900
We'll use some basic transformations to make sure

23
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:27,110
our data is nicely cleaned up and without any clutter.

24
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:31,835
This will involve things like making sure our data is clearly labeled,

25
00:01:31,835 --> 00:01:34,085
that we have all the right columns,

26
00:01:34,085 --> 00:01:37,115
and that these columns have logical headers,

27
00:01:37,115 --> 00:01:41,524
and that we've also removed any null rows that are just taking up space.

28
00:01:41,524 --> 00:01:45,050
This queues up our data for either data model usage or

29
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:50,110
the more significant transformations we'll go through in an upcoming lesson.

30
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:55,580
Another important part of preparing our data will involve identifying and using

31
00:01:55,580 --> 00:02:01,280
the correct data types so that calculations and visualizations will work as intended.

32
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,885
This might sound obvious,

33
00:02:02,885 --> 00:02:06,410
but using the wrong data types when you're first

34
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:10,970
getting the data can cause trouble later on when you go to generate your report.

35
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:13,295
To give a really simple example,

36
00:02:13,295 --> 00:02:16,075
you might have some sales data like we have here.

37
00:02:16,075 --> 00:02:20,224
Suppose you want to add up the subtotals to get the sum of all the sales,

38
00:02:20,224 --> 00:02:22,880
but you find that you're unable to sum them and that

39
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:27,425
your only option for aggregating this value is instead by count.

40
00:02:27,425 --> 00:02:30,530
The reason is that when you ran your original query,

41
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:34,360
you used the wrong data type for this subtotal column.

42
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,640
What looks like a numerical value here or

43
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,480
numerical values here are actually stored as text strings.

44
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,200
In this lesson, we'll learn how to use the correct data types so we

45
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,910
avoid issues like this where having the wrong data type will get in our way.

46
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:55,430
Finally, we'll get into the syntax of the M formula language to help you better

47
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:57,650
understand how to make corrections after

48
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:01,705
the fact once you've made some preliminary transformations.

49
00:03:01,705 --> 00:03:03,215
By the end of this lesson,

50
00:03:03,215 --> 00:03:06,080
we'll know how to load and tidy up our data so that it's ready

51
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,260
for the more advanced transformation wizardry we'll be doing later,

52
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:14,255
and it will have the right structure and data types we need for the final report.

53
00:03:14,255 --> 00:03:16,445
By the end of this lesson,

54
00:03:16,445 --> 00:03:19,160
we'll know how to load and tidy up our data so

55
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,160
that it is ready for the more advanced transformation

56
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,160
wizardry we'll be doing later and has

57
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:29,670
the right structure and data types we need for the final report.
