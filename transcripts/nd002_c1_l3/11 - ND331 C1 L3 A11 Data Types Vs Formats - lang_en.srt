1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,495
In Power BI, there are data types and there are data formats.

2
00:00:05,495 --> 00:00:09,000
Data types impact the way that Power BI allows

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,945
the data to be used within Power BI reports and calculations.

4
00:00:12,945 --> 00:00:17,040
Guessing data types is one of the ways that Power BI will try to help.

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,050
But often it'll guess wrong,

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,590
and you'll want to review this before you are trying to make a visual,

7
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:26,295
and I can't figure out why the value of sum or why

8
00:00:26,295 --> 00:00:30,720
your DAX calculation has time intelligence that isn't working.

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,140
Data formats in comparison impact the appearance of

10
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,990
data for presentation and for reporting purposes.

11
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:42,995
This can be an important way to make your analysis user friendly and easy to read,

12
00:00:42,995 --> 00:00:47,465
but it's not going to change the way the calculations themselves will work.

13
00:00:47,465 --> 00:00:52,250
Let's start by discussing the three most common datatype categories.

14
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:59,015
Date/time data categories are the kind of things that include date, time,

15
00:00:59,015 --> 00:01:00,830
or combinations of the two,

16
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:06,460
and they facilitate time intelligence such as DAX calculations like year to date.

17
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,270
Date tables also need

18
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:16,805
at least one date type date column to be able to explicitly be marked as a date table,

19
00:01:16,805 --> 00:01:19,505
and for your data model that's going to be imported,

20
00:01:19,505 --> 00:01:22,895
not only for ensuring that time intelligence is working correctly,

21
00:01:22,895 --> 00:01:26,000
but also to make sure that the data is working

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,460
the way that you need it to for the purposes of your visualizations.

23
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:33,860
Texts strings are what you use generally

24
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:38,090
when we're dealing with a description of individual transactions,

25
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:44,380
or when you're dealing with groupings that are words rather than numbers.

26
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:51,035
Then the number types have three different flavors with subtly different purposes,

27
00:01:51,035 --> 00:01:52,700
which we'll discuss next.

28
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:58,735
With number types, you want to choose wisely because they have subtly different purposes.

29
00:01:58,735 --> 00:02:01,355
You want to use whole numbers when

30
00:02:01,355 --> 00:02:05,420
your source information contains no decimals or fractions.

31
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,930
But note that this does not mean that the calculation like

32
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:13,595
an average of that field will still be reflected using only whole numbers.

33
00:02:13,595 --> 00:02:16,550
There's also a very specific use case around

34
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:21,080
managing intermediary rounding in calculations that's a bit beyond our scope.

35
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,110
But I'll include a link where you can learn more.

36
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:30,300
Use fixed decimals when you need any rounding to be predictable and precise.

37
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,050
Note that this is not the same as when you update

38
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:35,660
the number format in Power BI's reporting layer.

39
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:41,145
The fixed decimal type will limit the rounding for calculations,

40
00:02:41,145 --> 00:02:44,420
where reducing the number of decimals in

41
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:48,830
the formatting will only shrink the number shown for presentation,

42
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:54,170
and that'll be irrespective of what may have been used in the intermediary steps.

43
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:58,730
Currencies are the primary use for fixed decimals.

44
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:04,355
If you don't want to see a pending rounding error for a financial report, for example,

45
00:03:04,355 --> 00:03:06,470
you want to fix decimal type,

46
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:11,230
and you want to ensure that everyone's rounding to the same number of decimals.

47
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:14,990
Finally, in most other instances,

48
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:16,850
you will be using a decimal.

49
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:19,585
This is by far the most common number type.

50
00:03:19,585 --> 00:03:24,155
There are a few additional data types that are less common but handy.

51
00:03:24,155 --> 00:03:27,960
These are true/false, which is basically a Boolean,

52
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,435
it's either one or the other.

53
00:03:30,435 --> 00:03:36,950
Binary, which is really a temporary special datatype used just in the Query Editor.

54
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:39,440
It doesn't really play nice with data models,

55
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,810
and if you're loading binary files,

56
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:47,465
this is the preliminary data type that you'll use to load your data into Power Query,

57
00:03:47,465 --> 00:03:50,810
which you should then adjust or remove,

58
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,540
depending on what your needs are.

59
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,365
If you choose to keep this column,

60
00:03:54,365 --> 00:03:56,875
you're going to want to change its type.

61
00:03:56,875 --> 00:04:03,110
Finally, percentage is actually a decimal value masquerading as its own type,

62
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:06,770
but I have to say it's awfully handy to be able to see a percentage

63
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:11,705
sometimes in the Power Query Editor when you're reviewing the data for accuracy.

64
00:04:11,705 --> 00:04:17,520
There's no harm in using it in the Power Query Editor if it helps you with validation.
