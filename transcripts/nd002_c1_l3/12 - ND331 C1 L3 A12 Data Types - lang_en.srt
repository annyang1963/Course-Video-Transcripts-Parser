1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,850
I'm going to select the first five,

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,645
and then right click,

3
00:00:06,645 --> 00:00:09,855
and I'll choose "Remove Other Columns".

4
00:00:09,855 --> 00:00:14,745
Now, the only columns remaining are the five that I've selected.

5
00:00:14,745 --> 00:00:17,490
Let's take a look at these data types.

6
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:25,140
It looks like Power BI has done us a favor and selected each of these correctly.

7
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,700
Category is chosen for type Text, so is Commodity.

8
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,950
Then over here for the PLU number,

9
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,875
it's selected this 123,

10
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:36,660
which means Whole Number.

11
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:41,220
You might ask yourself whether you should keep the PLU as a number or

12
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:45,740
as a text so you don't have to worry about it summing up in the report.

13
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:49,460
For now, I think I'm going to go ahead and leave it as a number in case I want to

14
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:53,345
filter produce based on PLU value ranges later on.

15
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:57,660
I'll just include delta sum when I get to reporting.

16
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,375
Let's move on to the Store Calendar.

17
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:02,574
Here on the Store Calendar,

18
00:01:02,574 --> 00:01:11,060
I'm going to promote the headers and then I'm going to take over for Power BI with type.

19
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:19,980
I'm going to click here to choose Date as my selected data type for Date,

20
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,735
and for Month and Year,

21
00:01:21,735 --> 00:01:24,660
I'm going to choose "Whole Number".

22
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:29,100
Whole Number gives us the option to also select greater than or less than.

23
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,950
It's useful to have the number type for both of these.

24
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:40,020
Finally, on Sales, I'm going to change the Date column to type Date,

25
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:44,115
PLU column to type Whole Number,

26
00:01:44,115 --> 00:01:48,785
Amount to Fixed Decimal, to again,

27
00:01:48,785 --> 00:01:52,085
avoid fractions of pennies in our calculations,

28
00:01:52,085 --> 00:01:54,965
Cost to Fixed Decimal as well,

29
00:01:54,965 --> 00:01:59,560
and Subtotal finally as Fixed Decimal.

30
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,590
Now I have my demo file all tidied up with the right number types,

31
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,360
and it's your turn to give it a shot.
