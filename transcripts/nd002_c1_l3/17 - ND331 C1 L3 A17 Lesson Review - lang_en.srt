00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,235
To recap, in this lesson,

2
00:00:02,235 --> 00:00:05,279
we zoomed in on the first step of our pipeline,

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:08,355
loading and transforming data with Power Query.

4
00:00:08,355 --> 00:00:12,090
First, we learned how to access the data and we

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,810
learned how to do this using the Get Data feature.

6
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:18,510
We looked at the options you have at your fingertips to

7
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,330
pull data together from Power BI and we discussed

8
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,450
some creative approaches you can take if Power BI doesn't

9
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:28,515
already have a ready connection for what you need out of the box.

10
00:00:28,515 --> 00:00:32,595
Such as web scraping or leveraging an open database connector.

11
00:00:32,595 --> 00:00:37,290
Then we learned how to tidy up the data to make it easier for you, your end-users,

12
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:41,955
and Power BI to easily find and use the data you need.

13
00:00:41,955 --> 00:00:44,720
We saw that the initial data we get from a query

14
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:48,110
before we've tidied up can have a whole bunch of

15
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:51,680
issues and we use some basic transformations to

16
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,890
make sure our data is nicely cleaned and without any clutter.

17
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,915
This queues up our data for either data model usage or

18
00:00:59,915 --> 00:01:04,075
the more significant transformations we'll go through in an upcoming lesson.

19
00:01:04,075 --> 00:01:08,390
Another important part of preparing our data involves identifying and using

20
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:13,640
the correct data types so that calculations and visualizations work as intended.

21
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,130
In this lesson, we learned how to use

22
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:20,165
the correct data types such as texturing, fixed decimal, date,

23
00:01:20,165 --> 00:01:23,900
and true-false to constrain your data and ensure that these fields

24
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:28,465
will calculate correctly in your data model and resulting report.

25
00:01:28,465 --> 00:01:33,950
Finally, we learned how to use the M formula language to

26
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:39,460
make corrections after the fact once we've made some preliminary transformations.

27
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,615
If you followed along with all of this,

28
00:01:41,615 --> 00:01:45,110
you now know how to load and tidy up your data so

29
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:48,965
it's ready for the more advanced transformation wizardry we'll be doing later,

30
00:01:48,965 --> 00:01:54,150
and so it has the right structure and data types we need for the final report.
