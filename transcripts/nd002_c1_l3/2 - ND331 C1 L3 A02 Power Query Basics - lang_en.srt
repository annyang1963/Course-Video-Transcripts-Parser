1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
Like we discussed earlier,

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,990
Power BI works well with a range of

3
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:08,475
data sources with new sources added on an ongoing basis.

4
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:13,725
Some of the Power BI data sources I really want to highlight for you are databases.

5
00:00:13,725 --> 00:00:16,094
This includes SQL Server,

6
00:00:16,094 --> 00:00:20,100
Azure Cloud Server, Oracle databases, and many others.

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,840
Power BI has quite an extensive list of databases available as data sources,

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,665
so if your organization uses one, it's probably available.

9
00:00:28,665 --> 00:00:32,175
Social media, things like Facebook and LinkedIn,

10
00:00:32,175 --> 00:00:35,635
online services commonly used for businesses,

11
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:38,825
and the options here are also quite extensive.

12
00:00:38,825 --> 00:00:41,605
A few of them that jumped out to me were Salesforce,

13
00:00:41,605 --> 00:00:43,875
Google Analytics, and QuickBooks.

14
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:51,200
There's also a number of big data software options including Hadoop, Spark, and Impala.

15
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,805
If you've been wondering what that yellow elephant has been doing in our prior slides,

16
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:58,495
that's the adorable symbol of Hadoop,

17
00:00:58,495 --> 00:01:02,210
and of course, flat files and folders that hold

18
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:08,150
flat files are also an important part of the Power Query source universe.

19
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:09,920
These are your Excel files,

20
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,070
your CSVs, PDFs, and the folders that hold them.

21
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:18,530
So these are some of our possible data sources,

22
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:21,670
but how do we actually get to the data?

23
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:27,005
You're Get Data options is essentially the short answer to this,

24
00:01:27,005 --> 00:01:30,470
and it would be impossible for us to go through how to connect to each and every

25
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:33,950
one of them given the sheer number of options available,

26
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:36,200
but as a general rule of thumb,

27
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:41,410
your data source will probably work if the data is structured in columns and rows,

28
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:45,215
and if you have the necessary access rights to use it.

29
00:01:45,215 --> 00:01:48,080
There's a range of ways that you can take

30
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,870
data that doesn't have a preset way to connect to

31
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:56,500
Power BI itself and still make that data accessible for your data model if you need it.

32
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,930
Some of the options available to accomplish this are

33
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:06,170
web APIs or connections to the web in general where you can scrape data as well.

34
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:14,000
You can use open database connectivity or ODBC to make a connection to a vendor.

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,250
You can leverage either R or Python scripts to create a data connection,

36
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:22,970
or you can use Power Query SDK which

37
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:26,965
is a way that you can create a custom data connector for Power BI.

38
00:02:26,965 --> 00:02:29,750
Most people will never really need to use

39
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:33,545
these more advanced options on their various Power BI adventures,

40
00:02:33,545 --> 00:02:38,935
but I want you to know that these possibilities are available if you want or need them.

41
00:02:38,935 --> 00:02:42,680
So if the two things that we mentioned before were true,

42
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:47,560
that's the columns and row structure and necessary access rights,

43
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,210
then thankfully the general steps to get and

44
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:53,810
transform the data are consistent regardless of the source.

45
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:57,535
You'll need to tell Power Query where the data is,

46
00:02:57,535 --> 00:03:00,920
you'll need to provide credentials for that data source,

47
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:05,395
you'll need to choose the source tables to pull in,

48
00:03:05,395 --> 00:03:09,320
and you're going to want to customize in Power Query to

49
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:14,480
tidy things up and transform the data so it works for the report you want to generate.

50
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,675
Once the source has been imported into Power Query,

51
00:03:17,675 --> 00:03:22,520
it really is just another query regardless of the original source.

52
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:27,215
The way that you make changes to the data that came in from a CSV file, for example,

53
00:03:27,215 --> 00:03:33,270
really will be the same as what you would do to a data set from SQL or Salesforce.
