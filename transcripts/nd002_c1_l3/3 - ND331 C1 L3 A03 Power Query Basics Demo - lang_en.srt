00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,060
Let's take a look at this sales lead file.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:08,025
Here on my screen we have a CSV download that we got from our sales team.

3
00:00:08,025 --> 00:00:10,430
As you can see, the data here is pretty broad.

4
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:14,370
It does seem to have an interesting mix of descriptive data in

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:19,555
addition to some information that looks a little bit more facty.

6
00:00:19,555 --> 00:00:21,545
But how we use this table,

7
00:00:21,545 --> 00:00:24,455
whether as a fact table or a dimension table,

8
00:00:24,455 --> 00:00:28,160
potentially even both will drive some of our next steps.

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,815
First, let's proceed with getting the data.

10
00:00:30,815 --> 00:00:35,635
I've already downloaded this data set and saved it to my folder for this class.

11
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:41,365
So now we can go to Power BI and use the get data function to load it in.

12
00:00:41,365 --> 00:00:43,010
Now in Power BI,

13
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,750
I'm going to select get data,

14
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,125
text or CSV file, connect.

15
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:56,370
I'll choose my sales leaf file that we just looked at.

16
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:04,460
Here we have our default load from Power BI.

17
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:08,060
Power BI has quickly and correctly determined that

18
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:12,890
the delimiter here for our CSV file is a comma.

19
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:15,875
But if it had guessed wrong for any reason,

20
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:18,770
you could choose from this drop-down list to correct it,

21
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:20,975
to make sure that you have the right delimiter,

22
00:01:20,975 --> 00:01:26,710
which is used to determine what goes into each column based on the CSV file.

23
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:32,240
From here, you can either select load if this all looks perfect and

24
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,860
you have no updates that you need to make or you can choose transform data,

25
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:39,785
which will bring this to the Power Query Editor.

26
00:01:39,785 --> 00:01:43,500
I'm going to go ahead and select transform data.

27
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:51,785
Selecting transform data brought us to the Power Query Editor page.

28
00:01:51,785 --> 00:01:54,620
As you can see, the sales leads file is here on

29
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:57,815
the left ready for any updates to be made to it.

30
00:01:57,815 --> 00:01:59,915
If I wanted to add another query,

31
00:01:59,915 --> 00:02:03,860
all I would need to do at this stage is select new source.

32
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:10,860
That same get data list of options would be available and I would repeat the same steps.
