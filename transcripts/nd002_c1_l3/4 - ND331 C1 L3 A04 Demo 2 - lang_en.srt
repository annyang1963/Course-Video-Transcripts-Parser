1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,270
In this exercise, I asked you to first download

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:07,080
both Week 1 sales and the customer rewards Excel documents,

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,205
leave them in the downloads folder and import each into power BI's Power Query.

4
00:00:12,205 --> 00:00:15,334
Let me show you first how I did this myself.

5
00:00:15,334 --> 00:00:20,090
First, I opened up Power BI and I used the initial screen to get data.

6
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:21,995
If you close out of your screen,

7
00:00:21,995 --> 00:00:23,915
when you first open up Power BI,

8
00:00:23,915 --> 00:00:28,575
you can always bring it back by hitting this button here, for "Get data".

9
00:00:28,575 --> 00:00:34,310
We now navigate to the Excel option on the get data list and hit "Connect".

10
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:38,550
Now I'm going to move to my downloads folder.

11
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:42,760
I'll select Customer Rewards,

12
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:46,155
then I select the Table,

13
00:00:46,155 --> 00:00:48,120
and I'll select Transform.

14
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,415
Here on the Power Query Editor,

15
00:00:50,415 --> 00:00:52,730
I'm going to take the same steps,

16
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:57,320
but I'm going to use this button on the Home ribbon called New Source,

17
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,415
select Excel as well,

18
00:00:59,415 --> 00:01:02,950
and I'll select Week 1 Sales from here,

19
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,450
choosing the relevant section,

20
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:09,420
which for this is just one for Week 1 sales.

21
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:15,210
Here you can see the second query readily available.

22
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:19,490
Next, I asked you to create a dedicated folder and move

23
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:23,690
the two files from the downloads folder for safekeeping,

24
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:25,385
which when I make this change,

25
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:28,955
will of course trigger an alert from Power BI.

26
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:31,280
Now that I've moved them both,

27
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,370
when I select Refresh, we get an error.

28
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:38,885
I rather cruelly set you up to run into an error at the end of this exercise,

29
00:01:38,885 --> 00:01:44,270
one of the first things that I've noticed tends to really trip up new users in Power BI,

30
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,860
is when the data source changes,

31
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,525
but you're not sure how to fix it.

32
00:01:47,525 --> 00:01:50,450
This is one of those micro skills that I think

33
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:53,375
sometimes gets overlooked when you're learning Power BI.

34
00:01:53,375 --> 00:01:57,050
I wanted to give you a little hands-on experience on how it can

35
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:01,090
easily happen and how you can easily fix it.

36
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:03,160
Step 1, with the error message,

37
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,850
is not to panic.

38
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:06,950
There are a few different ways we can tackle this,

39
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:09,334
but first is to read the details.

40
00:02:09,334 --> 00:02:14,600
We can see here that the datasource error listed is they can't find the file.

41
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,945
We have several different ways we can update this.

42
00:02:17,945 --> 00:02:20,510
The most obvious is the go-to error,

43
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:25,190
which in this case wasn't super helpful.

44
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:28,730
We can see here that this is where it's

45
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:32,600
looking for the file that we're going to use for this query.

46
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,445
It's still not quite right.

47
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:38,785
To fix this, we can go to the source which is right here,

48
00:02:38,785 --> 00:02:41,460
and we can browse.

49
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:46,655
Instead of going to the Downloads folder where it's looking for it and can't find it,

50
00:02:46,655 --> 00:02:50,370
we're going to go to the folder where we saved it,

51
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:56,415
and the error disappears.

52
00:02:56,415 --> 00:03:00,305
You can see the data is all right here as you'd expect.

53
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:04,040
If we run the same refresh on the first table,

54
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,405
we get the same problem.

55
00:03:05,405 --> 00:03:09,050
I want to show you another way that you can fix this.

56
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:13,415
I like to use this option if you have multiple errors that have popped up.

57
00:03:13,415 --> 00:03:16,085
This lists all of them together.

58
00:03:16,085 --> 00:03:19,640
I'm just going to select the one that I want to fix,

59
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:24,995
choose Change Source, and then I'm going to perform the exact same steps.

60
00:03:24,995 --> 00:03:28,340
Previously it was looking for it in downloads,

61
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:32,520
now I'm asking to look for it in my lesson 3 file.

62
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:40,030
Close and refresh.

63
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:46,205
Since source file locations and names are subject to change,

64
00:03:46,205 --> 00:03:50,165
this is going to be important for you to know throughout your Power BI career.

65
00:03:50,165 --> 00:03:53,525
Though, I expect it will come in handy through this course as well.

66
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:55,100
At the end of each exercise,

67
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:58,115
we have a solutions PBIX file for your reference,

68
00:03:58,115 --> 00:04:00,925
and you can always use that to start your next exercise,

69
00:04:00,925 --> 00:04:02,585
but each time you do so,

70
00:04:02,585 --> 00:04:06,905
you need to update the source link to access your own desktop file.

71
00:04:06,905 --> 00:04:10,280
Otherwise, it's going to keep trying to connect to my C drive.

72
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,530
If you forget how to make this fix later,

73
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:16,770
you can always come back to the solution in the course for reference.
