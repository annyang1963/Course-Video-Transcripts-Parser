1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,780
It's important to understand that we can't just pull the data with

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:07,635
Power Query and expect it to be perfect the way it is.

3
00:00:07,635 --> 00:00:11,280
Getting the data also involve some tidying up.

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,245
So let's look at some common transformations that would help us do that.

5
00:00:16,245 --> 00:00:18,930
Let's start with a simple example.

6
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,995
Here's the result we might typically expect to see when we

7
00:00:22,995 --> 00:00:27,495
initially load a query before we've done any work to clean it up.

8
00:00:27,495 --> 00:00:31,650
This query is coming in with no column names and in fact,

9
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,910
it looks like that first row has the data that should be used for the names.

10
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,880
Then there's a whole bunch of rows that are null,

11
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,250
and the name is just query

12
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:46,970
1 and here's what we want the data to look like when we're done tidying it up.

13
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:50,120
We want to give the query a logical name.

14
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:55,855
We want to remove any null rows and promote the first column to headers.

15
00:00:55,855 --> 00:01:01,010
Most data sources will require some tidying to work in the data model even if

16
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:03,410
the structure that they come in as is working

17
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:06,485
perfectly to meet the needs for which they were designed.

18
00:01:06,485 --> 00:01:09,500
For example, tracking marketing projects or sales

19
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,325
leads where there might be a lot of spacing added in for ease of use.

20
00:01:13,325 --> 00:01:17,390
But making these transformations will make it easier for you,

21
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:20,630
your team, your report end users,

22
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:23,250
and for Power BI itself.

23
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,345
Let's start with tidying up for humans.

24
00:01:27,345 --> 00:01:30,560
We want to talk about how you want to

25
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,825
experience your data when you load it into Power BI as a query.

26
00:01:34,825 --> 00:01:39,740
Eventually queries also become tables and columns become fields.

27
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,785
When you're building a report at the end of this process,

28
00:01:42,785 --> 00:01:46,130
you certainly don't want to have to remember that column 2

29
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:50,170
is actually the quantity column and that query 7 is your fact table.

30
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:54,140
Now, is the best time to give everything a logical name that you can easily

31
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:58,105
recognize and you'd be comfortable seeing on the final report.

32
00:01:58,105 --> 00:02:02,480
Think of it from the perspective of someone who might take this over from you in a month.

33
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:07,130
You want them to be able to find things easily and make sense of how the queries work.

34
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:10,910
If only so they don't roll their eyes at how you built it.

35
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:15,040
We also want to tidy things up for the Power BI software.

36
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,135
As you continue to work with Power BI,

37
00:02:17,135 --> 00:02:21,450
you'll find that the software really wants to anticipate your needs where it can,

38
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:24,845
and it's going to do the work for you if it's able to.

39
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:28,790
For this reason, it's just as important that you help Power BI

40
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:32,885
understand what you're trying to accomplish as it is for your human colleagues.

41
00:02:32,885 --> 00:02:39,370
Two main ways we accomplish this are by removing rows and defining datatypes.

42
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:43,310
In both cases, we're cluing Power BI in on how

43
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:47,710
these fields should be treated according to Power BI's rules and logic.

44
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:51,890
Removing blank rows keeps Power BI from misinterpreting that we're

45
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:56,795
trying to use a nonexistent value in a key column, for example.

46
00:02:56,795 --> 00:03:01,520
Giving every column the right datatype is also important.

47
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,610
This ensures that Power BI can sum, divide,

48
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:08,375
and perform various other calculations for a numeric column

49
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:13,560
and tells Power BI to turn the on time intelligence for a date column.
