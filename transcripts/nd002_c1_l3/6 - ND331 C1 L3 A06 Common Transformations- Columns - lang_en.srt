00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
Commonly, this tidying focuses on cleaning up

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,735
individual columns and rows based on specific logic.

3
00:00:06,735 --> 00:00:08,610
Let's start with the columns.

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:11,205
I'll show you how this works in practice in a moment,

5
00:00:11,205 --> 00:00:12,810
but big picture,

6
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:17,085
you can remove columns or remove other columns.

7
00:00:17,085 --> 00:00:21,000
You can do this by either removing a specific individual column or you can

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,380
select the columns you want to keep and remove the other columns around them.

9
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:29,820
This can come in handy when you load a very large table with dozens of columns,

10
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,830
but you only need three.

11
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:35,960
You can rename columns to something more user-friendly,

12
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,890
think back to that report or you can reorder

13
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:45,365
your columns to whatever the preferred order is for you for ease of use.

14
00:00:45,365 --> 00:00:49,940
Note that there are many more column transformations beyond this,

15
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,660
which we'll get into during the next lesson.

16
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:56,750
One common source of concern newer Power BI users share

17
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:00,560
when they're transforming data in Power BI for the very first time,

18
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,290
is that they're afraid that they might delete something by

19
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:06,290
mistake by removing it in Power Query.

20
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:08,900
If there's one thing you take away from this lesson,

21
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,935
please let it be that you cannot damage the underlying data

22
00:01:12,935 --> 00:01:17,450
by manipulating or even breaking the query in Power Query.

23
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:22,220
What you see in the Power Query window is a reflection of the data from the source,

24
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:24,600
not the source data itself.

25
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,780
If you find that you need to adjust a transformation that you made earlier on,

26
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:32,570
it's actually quite easy to make those corrections,

27
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:35,485
something we'll talk about later in this lesson.

28
00:01:35,485 --> 00:01:40,040
Let's take a quick look at sales data for a corporate report.

29
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,920
The columns that you choose to remove or

30
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,510
keep will really depend on the use case that you have.

31
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:51,440
If you're working on a data set for a corporate report and have

32
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,580
a number of customer columns available from the sales team,

33
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:59,780
you might really just want to keep a few and remove the rest.

34
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:03,275
In comparison, if you are creating a data model,

35
00:02:03,275 --> 00:02:05,510
focus on the sales team's needs.

36
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:10,140
You might keep most of those columns and just remove the one.
