1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,145
Let's go back to the sales leads data set that we reviewed earlier and demoed loading.

2
00:00:05,145 --> 00:00:08,310
While there are many columns that are useful to the sales team,

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:13,215
we just need a few columns to be available for a bigger corporate forecasting projection.

4
00:00:13,215 --> 00:00:15,660
We'll go ahead and delete customer names,

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,575
emails, gender, and any other fields that won't be useful.

6
00:00:19,575 --> 00:00:21,915
For the purposes of this exercise,

7
00:00:21,915 --> 00:00:26,080
I'm just going to go ahead and delete columns from the data set I don't need,

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,705
which will be most of these.

9
00:00:27,705 --> 00:00:29,955
We'll just leave company, product name,

10
00:00:29,955 --> 00:00:33,430
date of contact, and prospective sales.

11
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:39,090
Prospective sales and date of contact are right here.

12
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,480
If I look towards the beginning,

13
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:48,210
I can see company right here.

14
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,310
There are two ways I can go about deleting columns that I don't need.

15
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:56,185
Option 1 is to delete a small number of columns.

16
00:00:56,185 --> 00:00:58,720
Say, I want to delete these first three.

17
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,340
I'm going to select them, what I did just now,

18
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:04,460
is I held down the shift key when I started with

19
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:08,520
prospective customer as I selected last name.

20
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,640
Then I'm just going to right-click and I'm going to remove the columns.

21
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,940
There we have our applied step right here.

22
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:17,965
As you can see,

23
00:01:17,965 --> 00:01:20,635
they disappeared from the table.

24
00:01:20,635 --> 00:01:23,570
The query that we're working in.

25
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:28,045
Option 2 is when you want to delete a high number of columns.

26
00:01:28,045 --> 00:01:30,895
You select the columns you want to keep,

27
00:01:30,895 --> 00:01:34,850
and then you choose the option to delete the other columns.

28
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:38,610
Here I'm going to hold down the control button and I'm going to

29
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:44,620
select company, product name,

30
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:47,920
which in this case is called product of interest,

31
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,170
then date of contact,

32
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:54,025
and prospective sales value.

33
00:01:54,025 --> 00:01:58,585
I have those columns selected and I'm going to

34
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:03,370
right-click here and see how instead of remove columns,

35
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,980
there's another option that says remove other columns.

36
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,885
I'm going to click that.

37
00:02:07,885 --> 00:02:13,735
All I have left are the five that I initially wanted, and somehow e-mail.

38
00:02:13,735 --> 00:02:18,490
Right-click, select remove, delete just one column,

39
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:20,255
and here we are; company,

40
00:02:20,255 --> 00:02:23,980
product of interest, date of contact, prospective sales, value.

41
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:26,410
Note that each time you make a change,

42
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:31,435
this lovely Applied Steps section continues to document each step.

43
00:02:31,435 --> 00:02:33,510
If I wanted to remove them,

44
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:37,770
all I have to do is click right here,

45
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:45,390
and those columns that were part of that step for removal have popped right back.
