00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,755
Onto rows, Power Query gives us a number of options for correcting rows,

2
00:00:04,755 --> 00:00:07,755
such as removing rows based on specific logic,

3
00:00:07,755 --> 00:00:14,490
which includes removing all rows where the values are blank or removing alternate rows,

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:18,840
which can be very helpful if you're using some sort of pre-structured report like

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,700
a Crystal Report that has output with every other row being blank,

6
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,650
can come in very, very handy.

7
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:30,810
You can also specify the top and bottom of rows to make sure that the rows

8
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:36,555
that you're removing are specific to exactly the number that you know need to go away.

9
00:00:36,555 --> 00:00:38,435
You can promote headers.

10
00:00:38,435 --> 00:00:42,680
This is where if the column names are showing up as values in row 1,

11
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,365
you can also take that first row

12
00:00:45,365 --> 00:00:48,710
and tell Power Query to push them up into the header level,

13
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:54,020
and you can remove duplicates based on the values in a specific row.

14
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:58,655
This can be helpful if you're dealing with a key column on a dimension table,

15
00:00:58,655 --> 00:01:04,565
say someone input a specific PLU code for our grocery store twice by mistake,

16
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:07,280
like what we saw with the Granny Smith Apple issue,

17
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,920
and we just need one to be available.

18
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,495
We just use that to delete otherwise identical information.

19
00:01:14,495 --> 00:01:17,900
You can also remove rows that contain errors,

20
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,480
and you can do so in a specific column,

21
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,155
or you can do it in any column that contains errors,

22
00:01:24,155 --> 00:01:29,315
but I do recommend caution with most row transformations.

23
00:01:29,315 --> 00:01:32,180
Unlike with columns, do hesitate

24
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:35,105
to delete rows if you're not sure whether they're needed,

25
00:01:35,105 --> 00:01:39,050
you need to be careful here because it's really easy to skew

26
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:43,489
the data without it being immediately obvious to those reviewing your report.

27
00:01:43,489 --> 00:01:48,484
It's still easy to undo a row tidying step just as it is for columns,

28
00:01:48,484 --> 00:01:51,380
but with columns, the field's either there or it isn't.

29
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,660
With rows, it may take some time to realize

30
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,755
something's at miss and then address the error.

31
00:01:56,755 --> 00:02:00,830
Take care with deleting rows with errors or duplicates, please.

32
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:04,380
With all that said, delete your blank rows.
