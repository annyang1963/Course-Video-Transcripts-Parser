1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,315
Let's head back to Power BI to look at a different query

2
00:00:03,315 --> 00:00:06,675
with the opposite problem that we saw in the earlier demo.

3
00:00:06,675 --> 00:00:08,685
Now we have too many rows.

4
00:00:08,685 --> 00:00:11,040
Here you can see as we scroll down,

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,350
there are a bunch of rows that have null values at the bottom,

6
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:19,935
and we don't want to load them into our data model for many reasons.

7
00:00:19,935 --> 00:00:23,130
One of them is that keys can't have null values,

8
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,265
so that would cause trouble with connecting to things.

9
00:00:26,265 --> 00:00:28,800
But the other is nulls take up space,

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,145
and we don't want them adding to the weight of our data model.

11
00:00:32,145 --> 00:00:37,005
What we're going to do is head up to the top,

12
00:00:37,005 --> 00:00:39,255
and we're going to select "Remove Rows".

13
00:00:39,255 --> 00:00:43,530
We can try using Remove Blank Rows, see how that did.

14
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:50,910
Apparently, only three of the four are showing up as null, so that won't work.

15
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:56,150
The next thing we can try is removing them from the bottom.

16
00:00:56,150 --> 00:01:00,990
Remove rows and you choose remove bottom rows.

17
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:05,810
I think there are about 20 rows towards the bottom,

18
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:07,860
so let's give that a try.

19
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,845
How do we do I missed 1,2,3,4,5,6.

20
00:01:13,845 --> 00:01:18,080
Remember how I said earlier that this is tracking everything we do.

21
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,650
Up here in the top we can see that step.

22
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:24,135
Remove last number, so remove rows,

23
00:01:24,135 --> 00:01:26,595
so we'll add 26.

24
00:01:26,595 --> 00:01:29,110
Easy enough to fix.

25
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:31,515
This is a good start.

26
00:01:31,515 --> 00:01:33,544
What we're going to want to do next,

27
00:01:33,544 --> 00:01:37,510
is go ahead and take this first row which at least has

28
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:42,970
our initial value that we want for a customer rewards members.

29
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:46,210
I want to use that as my field header.

30
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:48,445
What I'm going to do,

31
00:01:48,445 --> 00:01:52,250
is go to use first row as headers.

32
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,690
Great. That's a good start.

33
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:58,149
Now, I'm going to rename each of these columns,

34
00:01:58,149 --> 00:02:01,630
and you'll do this just like you're probably familiar with in Excel.

35
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:03,300
You just double click,

36
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:08,160
and we're going to call this customer name.

37
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:14,650
Double click, customer email,

38
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:21,785
double click customer phone number.

39
00:02:21,785 --> 00:02:25,160
Now there's one more step that we want to take,

40
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:29,585
and that's to give our query a useful name.

41
00:02:29,585 --> 00:02:32,690
It imported Table 1 from the Excel document,

42
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:35,900
but instead, I'm just going to name this customer,

43
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,620
so I can find it easily when I need it.

44
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:42,920
There you go. Two queries all cleaned up and ready to be useful.

45
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,480
Now, it's your turn to give it a try.
