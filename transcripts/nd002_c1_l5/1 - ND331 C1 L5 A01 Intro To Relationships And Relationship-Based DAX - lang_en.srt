1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,565
We've now learned how to access our data,

2
00:00:02,565 --> 00:00:06,345
tidying it up, and transforming it to create queries that we need.

3
00:00:06,345 --> 00:00:08,850
What we've done so far is the extract and

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:12,405
transform portion of extract, transform, and load.

5
00:00:12,405 --> 00:00:15,150
Now, it's time to close and load

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,990
our carefully structured queries so they become available as tables in Power BI.

7
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:23,120
Every step that we've taken up to this point is to pave

8
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,255
the path for the data model that we're about to put together.

9
00:00:26,255 --> 00:00:29,600
This lesson is about creating the relationships between

10
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:34,030
our tables and building the complete data model that we'll need for our report,

11
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:37,225
then using those relationships to create filters.

12
00:00:37,225 --> 00:00:41,030
We'll also create calculations through what Power BI refers

13
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:44,675
to as measures using data analytics expressions,

14
00:00:44,675 --> 00:00:47,165
more commonly known as DAX.

15
00:00:47,165 --> 00:00:51,905
These enrich our reporting and enhance our visualizations.

16
00:00:51,905 --> 00:00:54,470
The functional steps that we took to organize and

17
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:56,810
structure our data in the Power Query model,

18
00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:00,830
means that we have already created the types of tables that we need.

19
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:04,140
These are a fact table that is long and

20
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:09,660
thin with just the aggregatable data and the key columns that we need,

21
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:13,550
one or more dimension tables that are short and fat,

22
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:17,975
just with the descriptive data and a unique key listed for each row,

23
00:01:17,975 --> 00:01:22,765
which facilitates the relationship between the dimension and fact table,

24
00:01:22,765 --> 00:01:26,780
and we also have that date dimension table.

25
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,820
This contains one row per day,

26
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:33,470
which serves as our unique date key and customized columns for

27
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:38,870
whatever time data we need for our reporting needs such as fiscal calendar weeks,

28
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:41,720
months, day of the week, and so on.

29
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:45,095
Recall from the last lesson that we learned that an important step

30
00:01:45,095 --> 00:01:48,920
after making your date table is to mark it as a date table.

31
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:53,285
Otherwise, our time intelligence won't work as designed in Power BI.

32
00:01:53,285 --> 00:01:56,225
We'll do this first thing during our demo.

33
00:01:56,225 --> 00:01:59,045
As with our other dimension tables,

34
00:01:59,045 --> 00:02:01,850
we'll use the date key to build a relationship between

35
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:05,450
the date dimension table and the fact table as well.

36
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:12,065
At this stage, we've also identified data types for our columns within our tables,

37
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:14,569
which we'll also refer to as fields,

38
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:17,185
especially once we get to the reporting pane.

39
00:02:17,185 --> 00:02:21,930
The main ones we'll encounter are the date-time data types,

40
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:23,905
the text string data type,

41
00:02:23,905 --> 00:02:25,990
and the number data types.

42
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:32,140
These data types will define how each column can be used for various filters.

43
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:36,605
We'll also talk about measures. What is a measure?

44
00:02:36,605 --> 00:02:40,130
Measures are the ways that we express any of

45
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:43,820
our aggregatable facts or values in reporting context.

46
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,490
We've already discussed how in Power BI,

47
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:48,920
there's no such thing as a cell.

48
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,385
This is an extension of this concept.

49
00:02:51,385 --> 00:02:52,590
In the same way,

50
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:56,105
there's no number type field expressed independently.

51
00:02:56,105 --> 00:02:58,550
All aggregatable values pull into

52
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:03,875
the reporting pane in a way that it has to be expressed as part of an aggregation,

53
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:07,354
including min, max, average,

54
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:09,545
or count among others.

55
00:03:09,545 --> 00:03:14,920
In Power BI, measures fall into three kinds of categories.

56
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,674
We have our implicit DAX measures,

57
00:03:17,674 --> 00:03:20,990
which populate automatically in the reporting pane.

58
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:22,895
By default of fact,

59
00:03:22,895 --> 00:03:26,090
pulled onto the reporting pane will be expressed as a sum,

60
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:28,870
though you can always update this based on your needs.

61
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,965
We have quick DAX measures,

62
00:03:30,965 --> 00:03:33,350
which leverage more complex logic than

63
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:37,445
implicit measures but are commonly used and readily available.

64
00:03:37,445 --> 00:03:42,320
Then you have the option to create your own custom DAX measures.

65
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,590
Whenever people refer to measures in Power BI,

66
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:48,230
this is generally what they're referring to.

67
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:53,390
You can use DAX to either further customize quick measures or make your own measures.

68
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:58,130
For this lesson, we'll focus on two functions that make

69
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:04,440
good use of data model relationships and filtering, Calculate, and SumX.
