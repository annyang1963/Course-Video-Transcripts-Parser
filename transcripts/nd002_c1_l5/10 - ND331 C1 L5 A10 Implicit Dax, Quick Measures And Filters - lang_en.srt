00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,125
When it comes to reports and visuals in Power BI,

2
00:00:04,125 --> 00:00:06,555
I'd like to think of all of them in the context

3
00:00:06,555 --> 00:00:10,930
of each of them being filters or measures.

4
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:15,525
With the relationships in place from our data model,

5
00:00:15,525 --> 00:00:18,435
we can now get started on the report including

6
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:22,330
any necessary calculations and measures that will go within it.

7
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:25,590
So what's a report and what

8
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:29,385
does it have to do with everything that we just built up in the data model?

9
00:00:29,385 --> 00:00:32,790
Well, one way to think of it is that it reflects

10
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,570
the data in the model plus whatever filters are applied.

11
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,820
If you take a single value from your list of

12
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,030
field options and plop it into the reporting pane,

13
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,975
you'll get the total for the entire field.

14
00:00:44,975 --> 00:00:48,409
We can add filters in a number of spots,

15
00:00:48,409 --> 00:00:52,045
starting with the most obvious, the filter pane,

16
00:00:52,045 --> 00:00:59,645
which gives you the flexibility to apply filters for a single visual an entire page.

17
00:00:59,645 --> 00:01:03,560
So if you've noticed those tabs at the bottom of Power BI,

18
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,004
each of those constitute a page,

19
00:01:06,004 --> 00:01:10,940
or for all the report pages within your PBIX file.

20
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:14,990
One way to think of those fact and dimension columns that we were looking at

21
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:18,530
a little bit earlier is that the dimensions generally apply

22
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:24,410
the filters where the facts provide the values that get calculated

23
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:31,150
either through explicit or implicit measures as defined by those filters.

24
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:35,480
Everything that you add to a reporting pane will be a reflection of

25
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,750
not only the raw materials in your data model but also

26
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:42,310
the additional filters you add to the report itself.

27
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:46,550
So you can add visuals to your report and think of

28
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:52,220
those visuals such as a pie chart as having groups that function as filters.

29
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,770
Imagine in a pie chart where you have

30
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:58,845
multiple different categories breaking up parts of the whole.

31
00:01:58,845 --> 00:02:04,760
You can have a table with rows and columns that are functioning as filters of the data,

32
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:10,550
slicing and dicing it accordingly and you can use visuals called slicers that provide

33
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:18,095
end-users an easy functionality to select filters that you can use in the report itself.

34
00:02:18,095 --> 00:02:21,505
While we won't be touching deeply on the reporting pane,

35
00:02:21,505 --> 00:02:24,170
it's important to understand the mechanics of

36
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:26,900
these filters and measures and how they interact so

37
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,130
that you can get

38
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:33,180
the reporting visualizations that you need and troubleshoot them accordingly.
