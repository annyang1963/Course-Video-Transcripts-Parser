1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,325
Now that we're back on the reporting pane or view in Power BI,

2
00:00:05,325 --> 00:00:11,355
let's start by just grabbing a single value from our sales transactions.

3
00:00:11,355 --> 00:00:14,260
I'm going to go with amount.

4
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,055
With this single value,

5
00:00:26,055 --> 00:00:29,940
what we're doing is we're summing all the values associated with

6
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:35,190
this amount in the sales transaction without applying any additional filters or logic.

7
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:39,720
As you can see, the only thing on the filter pane at this stage is

8
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:44,900
the amount itself and every time that we add an additional value to a visualization,

9
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:48,530
that will populate automatically here on the filter pane.

10
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:54,125
Now, whenever you take a single value and you add it to Power BI,

11
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:57,110
the default is going to be that it will assume that you want to

12
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:01,330
use a table and that you want to use Sum.

13
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:02,960
But as you can see,

14
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,910
there are a number of additional options here,

15
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:11,240
something that we'll discuss a little bit later as we talk through the implicit measures.

16
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,995
Let's go ahead and add a dimension value to

17
00:01:15,995 --> 00:01:21,960
this small table that we have right here and I'll go ahead and make this a bit bigger.

18
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:31,400
For our purposes, let's just go ahead and

19
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:39,875
grab information from the customer data by state.

20
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:48,450
I'll just go ahead and drag this over to our table and of course I want to

21
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,950
see state before amounts so I'll go head on

22
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:57,310
the Visualization pane and I will take state and move it above amount.

23
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:03,320
Now we have values by customer data from this section listing off

24
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:10,190
the amount for sales functioning as a filter off of that same starting value.

25
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:13,190
If we take this away, that will still be the single total that we

26
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:20,060
see but sliced and diced based on the information that we want to include.

27
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,279
We can slice this further,

28
00:02:22,279 --> 00:02:27,950
say if we wanted to see it by zip code as well.
