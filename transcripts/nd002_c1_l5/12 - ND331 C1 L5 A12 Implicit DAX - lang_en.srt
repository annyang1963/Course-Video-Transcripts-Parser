00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,630
Let's talk now a little bit about implicit DAX.

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:09,255
These are the options that you have readily available when you right-click on a value,

3
00:00:09,255 --> 00:00:13,670
just like we did with that 3.3 million that we saw in the demo.

4
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:16,710
It will initially always default to sum,

5
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:20,580
which is I think the most commonly used option.

6
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,220
But as you can see in this screenshot I have here,

7
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,135
there are a number of other options readily available.

8
00:00:27,135 --> 00:00:30,930
Implicit DAX is essentially a series of

9
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:35,595
commonly used preset calculations that require no extra work for you.

10
00:00:35,595 --> 00:00:40,080
They're already available in the Power BI reporting view.

11
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,695
When you're using implicit DAX,

12
00:00:42,695 --> 00:00:44,990
you're going to have options that are very similar to

13
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:47,545
what you're used to an Excel, including sum,

14
00:00:47,545 --> 00:00:50,040
average, min, just in

15
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,610
a reporting context with

16
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:56,135
the same general options that you're seeing on the right-hand side.

17
00:00:56,135 --> 00:00:58,460
The caveat here is that

18
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:04,580
these implicit DAX options can only be used on an aggregatable column.

19
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:08,915
For example, you're not going to be able to use this on a text string.

20
00:01:08,915 --> 00:01:10,715
The way that you can tell

21
00:01:10,715 --> 00:01:16,010
whether or not the relevant column or in the reporting contexts the field

22
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:19,325
is an option for implicit DAX is to look for

23
00:01:19,325 --> 00:01:23,830
the sum symbol sitting next to it on the reporting pin.

24
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:26,885
Let's play with implicit DAX a little bit,

25
00:01:26,885 --> 00:01:30,710
like we talked about a little bit before on the slide.

26
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:38,000
When we are looking at the values and we pull them in from the fields on to the visuals,

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,610
you have some as your default,

28
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,075
but you have other options readily available.

29
00:01:44,075 --> 00:01:47,360
We can leave this as some.

30
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:57,450
But we can also add the same value and use average.

31
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:08,140
We can add it again and make it the minimum,

32
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:13,940
and we can continue to add it as many times as we wanted.

33
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:17,285
We can of course add other values as well.

34
00:02:17,285 --> 00:02:22,950
Any of these that had this little E symbol you're able to add.

35
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,630
They'll default to sum,

36
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:30,150
but you can make them whatever of these options you want very easily.

37
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:35,060
Of course, if the format like with average of

38
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,875
amount doesn't suit you or your purposes for reporting,

39
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:41,490
you can always adjust that.

40
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:47,975
The way that you adjust that is by selecting the source value and then going

41
00:02:47,975 --> 00:02:53,880
up to the column tools

42
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:58,400
to adjust not the type but the format.

43
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:04,250
We can do this for the values by adding currency if it wasn't there already,

44
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:07,400
or by adjusting so that we have

45
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:12,470
just two decimal places rather than a seemingly infinite number.

46
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:15,110
One more thing that we should touch on now that we have

47
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:18,124
this wonderful selection of filters available,

48
00:03:18,124 --> 00:03:23,570
is that we can go into the filter pane and make further adjustments here.

49
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:29,220
Something that we'll touch on as we move through filters in greater detail.
