1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,475
Let's talk about quick measures.

2
00:00:02,475 --> 00:00:07,350
Quick measures are the next level of built-in calculations that you can

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:12,645
apply to get the calculations you need specifically for aggregatable columns.

4
00:00:12,645 --> 00:00:17,700
They're like the more mature older sisters of the implicit DAX.

5
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,510
Like implicit measures, they don't require you to write DAX.

6
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,290
They are a really handy subset of calculations,

7
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,660
like the ones you see on the right hand,

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,200
right here from my screenshot and they're meant

9
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,040
to be high-use general-purpose calculations.

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:41,590
That said, you're not likely to be an escape by without using any DAX at all with them.

11
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:46,460
But I like that you can use them to learn new DAX calculations.

12
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,770
If you start off using a quick measure,

13
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:52,420
it does make it easier for you to learn DAX that's new to you,

14
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:56,060
and you can build on top of them to customize the DAX that

15
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:59,590
you build off of them to your specific needs.

16
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:02,540
I never got into the habit of using them since they were

17
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,705
introduced after I started working with Power BI and DAX,

18
00:01:05,705 --> 00:01:08,180
but I'm a little envious that you're getting to start

19
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:11,690
your Power BI adventure with these quick measures as a starting point.

20
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:13,535
Let's explore them together.

21
00:01:13,535 --> 00:01:15,560
Back in Power BI,

22
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,435
we have everything just where we left it off with the implicit measures.

23
00:01:20,435 --> 00:01:25,585
Let's start by right-clicking and selecting "New quick measure".

24
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:29,135
We'll start by just getting a little familiar with our options.

25
00:01:29,135 --> 00:01:31,475
Here we are in quick measures,

26
00:01:31,475 --> 00:01:32,975
and if we go through,

27
00:01:32,975 --> 00:01:36,145
it groups them by aggregate per category,

28
00:01:36,145 --> 00:01:40,880
filtering by specific values or percentages, and time intelligence,

29
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,800
which I have to say to me,

30
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,775
is the most useful if you wanted to see a month over month change.

31
00:01:46,775 --> 00:01:50,330
But of course, running totals with filters and

32
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:55,040
additional mathematical operations are additionally useful as well.

33
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,845
Let's start with something straightforward.

34
00:01:57,845 --> 00:02:01,770
How about a year-to-date total?

35
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:07,420
We're going to choose our base value, should be sum,

36
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:10,175
and instead of price each,

37
00:02:10,175 --> 00:02:15,690
I'm going to go to my Sales Transactions and I'm going to choose amount instead.

38
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,490
Then we need to add a date right here.

39
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:23,520
We have one of those from our date table.

40
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,950
As you see here at the top,

41
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:35,235
similar to what we saw before with the M-Code,

42
00:02:35,235 --> 00:02:39,515
where the user interface would develop M-Code for us,

43
00:02:39,515 --> 00:02:42,185
we have this little section where we can see

44
00:02:42,185 --> 00:02:48,020
the specific logic that's been applied on our behalf by Power BI for DAX,

45
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,795
again, data analytics expressions.

46
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:54,380
If we wanted this to be named something different,

47
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,165
we can freely do so.

48
00:02:56,165 --> 00:02:59,805
Test, DAX, year to date,

49
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:02,250
whatever you need it to be.

50
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,800
If you look at this,

51
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:09,965
it is creating slightly more advanced DAX than you might have interacted with before.

52
00:03:09,965 --> 00:03:15,670
Supplying the sum, total year to date by date, date.

53
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:18,840
I'd really encourage you to explore this further,

54
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,810
it can be a lot of fun to play with these.

55
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:26,690
You can always just like we showed you just now with the test DAX year to date,

56
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:30,740
adjusting the name, you can go into this and make further adjustments

57
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:35,790
to make these quick measures meet your specific needs.

58
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:42,055
Let's talk about different filters for different datatypes.

59
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:45,890
Filter options that you have whether you're developing

60
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:50,915
them on the filter pane specifically for a specific visual,

61
00:03:50,915 --> 00:03:55,909
or if you're putting them into a DAX formula,

62
00:03:55,909 --> 00:04:01,760
are essentially determined by the datatype irrespective of what that filter context is.

63
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,790
Practically speaking, this means that you may not

64
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:08,330
always be able to filter the way you would expect to be able to,

65
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:11,470
depending on whether the data is type date,

66
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:14,730
text string, or number.

67
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:17,205
Let's start with dates.

68
00:04:17,205 --> 00:04:21,560
Dates give you the option to filter between certain dates,

69
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,110
before or after certain dates,

70
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:27,530
to manually select specific dates,

71
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:30,230
or to filter for relative dates.

72
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:32,900
This could be really handy if you say,

73
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,460
wanted to filter a report,

74
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,455
so it just shows the current year,

75
00:04:36,455 --> 00:04:38,875
the past year, or a future one.

76
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:42,860
However, there are some limitations when you're trying

77
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:46,880
to use a date component in a filter context.

78
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,730
An example that I've run into before is when you

79
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:53,165
have a month that's stored as a whole number.

80
00:04:53,165 --> 00:04:56,990
This'll let you filter using the number context,

81
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:59,300
but it won't give you option for relative dates,

82
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,735
say if you wanted to be looking at the same month last year.

83
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:05,870
It's not a big deal if you run into this

84
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:09,050
because you can simply use the date field instead,

85
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:12,170
but it is important to know this distinction so that

86
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:15,905
you're not stuck when you're working through your filter options.

87
00:05:15,905 --> 00:05:19,730
With text strings, you can filter based on whether

88
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:23,560
a field contains or does not contain certain information.

89
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,175
In a basic sense,

90
00:05:25,175 --> 00:05:31,270
you have the option to simply select all or choose specific fields from a drop-down list,

91
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:34,760
but with advanced, you're using contains,

92
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,025
does not contain, is blank,

93
00:05:37,025 --> 00:05:38,720
or is not blank.

94
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,564
Then with numbers, you're working with less than,

95
00:05:43,564 --> 00:05:47,415
greater than, is, is not.

96
00:05:47,415 --> 00:05:50,780
This gives you a lot of options to be able to group

97
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:56,060
things based on the number contexts and based on ranges of numbers.

98
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:00,005
But if you wanted to filter with say, StartsWith,

99
00:06:00,005 --> 00:06:02,315
which is a text string option,

100
00:06:02,315 --> 00:06:06,605
you will have to approach it differently using a range instead.

101
00:06:06,605 --> 00:06:08,670
The converse is also true.

102
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:13,745
If you have a value that appears to be a number but it's stored as a text string,

103
00:06:13,745 --> 00:06:18,275
it will allow you to filter for the first value, for example, six,

104
00:06:18,275 --> 00:06:23,995
but not for a range of values which might be preferable depending on your situation.

105
00:06:23,995 --> 00:06:29,045
Here we are back in our reporting view in Power BI.

106
00:06:29,045 --> 00:06:33,665
Let's take a look at some filters and see how they work in context.

107
00:06:33,665 --> 00:06:36,784
If we go back to the filters on this visual,

108
00:06:36,784 --> 00:06:39,320
we can start with State,

109
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,100
which is a text string.

110
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,720
We've got our basic filtering with this drop-down list.

111
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:52,875
Say we only want to see individuals in California from our customer data list.

112
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:55,225
I've selected California only,

113
00:06:55,225 --> 00:06:58,865
and it's given me the list just for the State of California.

114
00:06:58,865 --> 00:07:02,515
But let's say that rather than requiring

115
00:07:02,515 --> 00:07:06,770
a selection using just clicking through the list here,

116
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:14,885
we can use advanced filtering instead if we want to have a more nuanced filter in place.

117
00:07:14,885 --> 00:07:17,075
Instead of is Alabama,

118
00:07:17,075 --> 00:07:20,645
which is pretty similar to the basic filtering

119
00:07:20,645 --> 00:07:27,755
where we would just use is Alabama here with a single click.

120
00:07:27,755 --> 00:07:32,525
With advanced filtering, we can use contains.

121
00:07:32,525 --> 00:07:39,410
If we wanted to grab both Dakotas,

122
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:41,540
which I'm not sure if they're in this list,

123
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,085
but say we did,

124
00:07:43,085 --> 00:07:48,450
we could say contains Dakota,

125
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:54,305
and we can hit "Apply filter" to determine indeed there is no Dakota.

126
00:07:54,305 --> 00:08:01,680
Or show items where the value is Dakota or California.

127
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:10,830
We've got our list of California options back.

128
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:14,435
You can also choose the top end.

129
00:08:14,435 --> 00:08:20,220
Show items with the top or bottom by the data fields,

130
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:23,610
so top or bottom say, by amount.

131
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:30,690
Top 1 by

132
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:35,800
amount, "Apply filter".

133
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:41,780
We've got Texas as our top 1 state.

134
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:45,050
Let's play with some other stuff now.

135
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:48,085
I don't know if you caught that.

136
00:08:48,085 --> 00:08:51,310
But just to show you, again,

137
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:57,325
if I go back to basic filtering and I just select one of these,

138
00:08:57,325 --> 00:09:03,350
I can go to "Clear filter" to return it to the default which is select all.

139
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:08,725
If we use zip code,

140
00:09:08,725 --> 00:09:15,275
which we can check right now and see how it's being treated as a number.

141
00:09:15,275 --> 00:09:20,570
Zip code is going to give us the option of choosing less than,

142
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:23,405
greater than, is, is not.

143
00:09:23,405 --> 00:09:26,060
We could choose is greater than

144
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:33,415
29,000 and less than

145
00:09:33,415 --> 00:09:38,140
or equal to 80,000,

146
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:41,855
"Apply filter", and that will give us a range in the middle.

147
00:09:41,855 --> 00:09:47,605
But we may decide that that's not necessarily practical and we could use is, is not, etc.

148
00:09:47,605 --> 00:09:52,620
Then finally, when we talk about amount,

149
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:55,940
which is another number option,

150
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:58,925
you'll be applying similar logic here.

151
00:09:58,925 --> 00:10:02,830
What if we wanted to look at date instead?

152
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:05,810
Well, this is already showing us a list of

153
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:08,750
options based on things that we've already selected.

154
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,780
But just because the filter pane automatically

155
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:15,890
applies the information that's pulled into our visualizations for these values,

156
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:18,620
doesn't mean that our filter pane is

157
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:22,190
limited by the ones that automatically populated here.

158
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:26,115
We can go ahead and grab year, for example,

159
00:10:26,115 --> 00:10:30,380
and if we put it in this Add data fields here,

160
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,920
it will populate for us.

161
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:39,125
We can use advanced filtering since it's being treated as a number here.

162
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:48,575
We could say is greater than 2018 and it will filter our dataset based on 2018,

163
00:10:48,575 --> 00:10:53,090
this was 3.3 million, now it's 754,000,

164
00:10:53,090 --> 00:11:01,585
meaning that 754,000 and change sales occurred after 2018.

165
00:11:01,585 --> 00:11:06,485
If we wanted to use the date dimension, we'd grab date,

166
00:11:06,485 --> 00:11:11,940
date, and pull it in as a data field.

167
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:19,800
There we go. We've pulled in date, date,

168
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:24,535
it's set to is all and it's giving us basic relative date,

169
00:11:24,535 --> 00:11:26,809
relative time, and advanced.

170
00:11:26,809 --> 00:11:31,775
Advanced would give us on or after, on or before,

171
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:32,995
is or is not blank,

172
00:11:32,995 --> 00:11:35,080
including for time if that's important for

173
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,820
your dataset and it also gives you relative date.

174
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:42,970
Show items when the value is in the last 365 days,

175
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:44,650
for example, including today,

176
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:48,250
apply the filter, and this would show us everything in

177
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:53,035
the past year using this specific parameter.

178
00:11:53,035 --> 00:11:56,320
As you can see, as a recording,

179
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:05,900
we're here on 2/23 and it's pulling in data for this 365-day range.
