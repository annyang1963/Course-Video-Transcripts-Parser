00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,990
Let's revisit the grocery store report that we used

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:08,490
at the very beginning of these lessons for the big picture demo.

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,250
We've already gone through the process at

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,235
this stage of extracting and transforming our data,

5
00:00:14,235 --> 00:00:16,980
we have three well-structured tables

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,745
right here or queries that will become table shortly,

7
00:00:20,745 --> 00:00:24,630
and for us to transform them from queries to tables,

8
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,285
we're going to select, "Close and Apply".

9
00:00:27,285 --> 00:00:30,300
This would also be the stage at which if we had

10
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,990
any additional intermediary queries like the ones that we

11
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:40,825
did to get the dates at the end of our date table process during our prior lesson,

12
00:00:40,825 --> 00:00:46,040
we would right-click and select "Disable Load" so that they don't gum up

13
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:51,620
the space when we move into the data modeling and reporting stage.

14
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:54,860
But since we have all that we need exactly as is,

15
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:58,745
we'll go ahead and close and apply which brings us

16
00:00:58,745 --> 00:01:03,380
to the model pane where we have our three tables at place.

17
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,150
Now before we get started,

18
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:10,355
I want to make sure that we label our date table as a date table.

19
00:01:10,355 --> 00:01:13,970
The first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to take

20
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:18,820
the Store_Calendar date table and I'm going to explicitly market in the date table.

21
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,830
The way I'm going to do that is by going over to

22
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:26,800
the data pane and I'm going to select Marcus date table,

23
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:32,915
I'll select the relevant column which presses date.

24
00:01:32,915 --> 00:01:35,990
Right here it has gone through the process of making

25
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:39,270
sure that we've satisfied the requirements of a date table,

26
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:43,015
so you can see it has validated successfully,

27
00:01:43,015 --> 00:01:46,640
and that'll turn on the different functions when it comes to time,

28
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,800
intelligence, and everything else.

29
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:56,020
From here, all we're going to do is take the key columns and connect them together.

30
00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:01,040
Now, the user interface will allow you to just drag and drop to connect them,

31
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,500
but you can also go to Manage Relationships to add them if you choose and

32
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:14,075
select "New" and here we'll go to the Store Calendar,

33
00:02:14,075 --> 00:02:16,924
select the column that we want to connect,

34
00:02:16,924 --> 00:02:22,535
and then I'm going to choose the sales fact table and the column I want to connect here.

35
00:02:22,535 --> 00:02:26,135
It's identified that it's a one-to-many relationship,

36
00:02:26,135 --> 00:02:29,465
one being coming from the store calendar,

37
00:02:29,465 --> 00:02:31,069
many on the sales,

38
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:34,500
and it's identified a single filter.

39
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:39,720
We'll go through all of those in a little bit.

40
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,520
If I ever want to look at these again and see the details,

41
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:50,380
I just double-click and the data pops up.

42
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:53,350
Finally, on the reporting pain,

43
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:59,020
we have a number of options for being able to create visuals,

44
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,555
but also to create a range of measures.

45
00:03:01,555 --> 00:03:04,510
So you recall the subtotal measure here.

46
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:06,970
It's defaulted as a Sum,

47
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:13,920
but I can always change it to Average, Min, Max, etc.

48
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,710
which we will go through in a little bit.

49
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:21,835
We have a filter pane that gives us options for either creating

50
00:03:21,835 --> 00:03:27,175
additional filtering for the entire report or sections of it,

51
00:03:27,175 --> 00:03:34,395
and you have the additional option to create filters both through quick measures,

52
00:03:34,395 --> 00:03:35,940
which if we right-click,

53
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:42,830
"New Click Measure" you'd get a series of options that will allow you to

54
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:45,560
filter based on a category which functions as

55
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:51,030
a measure or explicitly create filters in a calculation.
