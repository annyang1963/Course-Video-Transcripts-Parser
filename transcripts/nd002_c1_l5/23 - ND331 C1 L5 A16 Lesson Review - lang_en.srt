1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,060
So this lesson was all about

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:07,095
relationships and filters and the measures that they facilitate.

3
00:00:07,095 --> 00:00:10,665
We started by defining different relationship types,

4
00:00:10,665 --> 00:00:12,435
also known as cardinality,

5
00:00:12,435 --> 00:00:15,015
and the filtering directions of relationships,

6
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:19,140
which play an important role in how data is reflected in reports.

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,540
As you learned in this lesson,

8
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:25,020
the existence of a relationship doesn't do you any good unless the setup is correct,

9
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:29,130
and even though Power BI will try to recognize relationships on your behalf,

10
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,330
it's important to know relationships well enough to determine whether Power BI has

11
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:39,010
helped in the right way or if perhaps you need to make some corrections.

12
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,080
We also discussed filtering in

13
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:49,220
a reporting context and the different ways that filters can be applied,

14
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:52,430
layering on top of not only the filtering pane but

15
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:57,440
individual groupings in visuals, slicers, etc.

16
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,919
We went through implicit DAX and quick measures,

17
00:01:00,919 --> 00:01:06,620
which are the simplest ways to get your calculations into your reporting context,

18
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:12,190
including basic such as some min-max and average on the implicit side,

19
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:15,755
and more advanced quick measures that are still

20
00:01:15,755 --> 00:01:21,510
readily available for you to use as is out of the quick measure list.

21
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:28,595
Then we went through the two custom DAX functions that rely on filters the most,

22
00:01:28,595 --> 00:01:30,715
which are SUMX and CALCULATE.

23
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:34,370
These are the Swiss Army knife-type custom DAX functions

24
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:36,710
that I lean on time and time again,

25
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:40,220
and that we use in conjunction with filters that we can add

26
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:45,175
into the calculations such as filter, all, and relationship.

27
00:01:45,175 --> 00:01:48,260
We also touched a little bit on USERELATIONSHIP,

28
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:52,580
which you would use in a many-to-many context or in circumstances

29
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:57,770
where you might have to leverage an inactive relationship in your model.

30
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:02,405
At this stage, we've gone through building your data model,

31
00:02:02,405 --> 00:02:05,810
making a report in the most basic of senses,

32
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:08,040
and creating some custom calculations,

33
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,860
so you're off to a great start.

34
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:14,300
Next lesson, we're going to learn how to build on this for those more unusual situations

35
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:19,580
where you need a little bit more of beyond-the-standard star schema.
