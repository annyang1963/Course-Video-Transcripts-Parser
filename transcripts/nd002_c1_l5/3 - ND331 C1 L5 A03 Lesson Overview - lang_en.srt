00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,880
This lesson is all about relationships and the filters and the measures they facilitate.

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:11,040
We'll start by defining the different relationship types also known as cardinality,

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,520
and the filtering of directions of relationships which play

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,360
an important role in how data is reflected in reports.

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,085
As you will learn in this lesson,

6
00:00:20,085 --> 00:00:25,079
the existence of a relationship doesn't do you any good unless the setup is correct,

7
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:29,280
and even though Power BI will try to recognize relationships on your behalf,

8
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,600
it's important to know relationships well enough to be able

9
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,760
to determine whether Power BI has helped us in the right way.

10
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:41,390
From there, we'll go into the handy implicit DAX measures that are built

11
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:46,010
into Power BI and can be used with a simple click in the reporting pane,

12
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:49,975
and their slightly more sophisticated sibling, the Quick Measures.

13
00:00:49,975 --> 00:00:52,190
We'll also discuss what filters can be

14
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:55,975
used in the reporting pane for different data types,

15
00:00:55,975 --> 00:00:58,085
and then we'll cover a couple of

16
00:00:58,085 --> 00:01:01,310
Swiss Army knife-type custom DAX functions that are

17
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:06,120
commonly used in conjunction with filters and get some practice using them.
