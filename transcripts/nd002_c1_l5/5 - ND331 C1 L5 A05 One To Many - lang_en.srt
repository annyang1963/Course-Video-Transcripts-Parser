1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,210
Let's talk about relationship properties.

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,025
Throughout this course so far,

3
00:00:05,025 --> 00:00:09,105
every relationship example has been a one-to-many relationship,

4
00:00:09,105 --> 00:00:12,540
with the one on the dimension side and the many on the fact side.

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,770
This is the relationship that you will use in almost every instance.

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,010
I might even go as far as to say that you're unlikely to need any of

7
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,020
the other relationship types if you're building

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,750
out your fact and dimension tables correctly.

9
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,140
That said, you do have some other options

10
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,245
beyond one-to-many when it comes to cardinality,

11
00:00:31,245 --> 00:00:34,575
even if one-to-many is generally your best choice.

12
00:00:34,575 --> 00:00:39,090
These include one-to-one and many-to-many.

13
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:44,735
Additionally, you can specify the direction that the relationship flows,

14
00:00:44,735 --> 00:00:49,520
either going one way from the dimension to the facts or both ways.

15
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,790
So filters can go in either direction between the facts and dimensions.

16
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:57,855
Let's start with one-to-many.

17
00:00:57,855 --> 00:01:01,795
One-to-many, with a single direction filter,

18
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:04,025
is the MVP of relationships.

19
00:01:04,025 --> 00:01:07,775
In plain English, that means there's one value in a single table,

20
00:01:07,775 --> 00:01:10,355
like the product dimension table on the left,

21
00:01:10,355 --> 00:01:14,015
that's correlated to multiple values of another table,

22
00:01:14,015 --> 00:01:16,715
like the sales fact table on the right.

23
00:01:16,715 --> 00:01:20,015
It's reverse, the many-to-one means the same.

24
00:01:20,015 --> 00:01:21,530
You just be starting with

25
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:25,400
the sales fact table and pointing it towards the product dimension table.

26
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,550
In general, you want the single value to be on

27
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:32,240
the dimension side and the many values to be on the fact side so that

28
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,365
all those good descriptive details can be listed just once and then

29
00:01:36,365 --> 00:01:41,240
associated with as many transactions or facts as are relevant for reporting.

30
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,680
Let's make this concrete with a couple of examples.

31
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,430
Like I mentioned, on the left,

32
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:51,545
we have our product dimension table with each apple variety listed just once,

33
00:01:51,545 --> 00:01:55,685
but the transaction sales listed many times on the transactions.

34
00:01:55,685 --> 00:01:57,620
Here's Fuji apples, for example,

35
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:02,935
showing up once on the product dimension but multiple times on the sales fact table.

36
00:02:02,935 --> 00:02:04,265
Then on the right,

37
00:02:04,265 --> 00:02:09,050
we have our date dimension table with 1/31 listed just once,

38
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:11,765
but multiple times on the sales fact table.

39
00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:16,380
Both of these constitute a one-to-many relationship.
