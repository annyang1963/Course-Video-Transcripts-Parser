1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,060
With cross-filter directions, we have

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:07,185
the option for our filters to be single or bi-directional.

3
00:00:07,185 --> 00:00:12,524
A single direction filter is usually our preferred option.

4
00:00:12,524 --> 00:00:16,200
The reason is that the filter can be applied in the direction of

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:21,205
the relationship from one table to another, reliably and consistently.

6
00:00:21,205 --> 00:00:24,770
This really will be your best option in most cases.

7
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:28,790
With both or a bi-directional relationship,

8
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:33,245
by default, the filters can be applied in either direction.

9
00:00:33,245 --> 00:00:36,845
This can be okay if you have a small table,

10
00:00:36,845 --> 00:00:39,620
but it doesn't necessarily scale and it does have

11
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:43,780
a performance impact that you have to take into account.

12
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,960
It's confusing for end-users,

13
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,175
and as you add additional tables to your data model,

14
00:00:49,175 --> 00:00:53,570
you have to additionally account for this bi-directional component,

15
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:57,710
which can result in odd output for your reports and can be very

16
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:02,770
confusing for those end-users to understand how the information is being applied.

17
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:04,790
If you find that you can't apply

18
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:07,595
a single direction filter to get your desired end results.

19
00:01:07,595 --> 00:01:11,240
Start by reviewing the data set first to confirm if indeed the

20
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,850
necessary base requirements for a one-to-many relationship are being satisfied.

21
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:18,860
Then review the guidance from Microsoft to

22
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:22,510
see if it makes sense to use a bi-directional filter.

23
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:25,340
A few specific use cases for

24
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:29,765
bi-directional filters include when you have a one-to-one relationship,

25
00:01:29,765 --> 00:01:31,670
which we'll discuss in a bit,

26
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:34,790
when you need to bridge tables to be able

27
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:37,940
to ensure that relationships are aligning correctly,

28
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:41,855
such as when you're trying to avoid a many-to-many relationship,

29
00:01:41,855 --> 00:01:45,535
and when you might have some unique slicer requirements.

30
00:01:45,535 --> 00:01:47,630
Additionally, if you have

31
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:53,300
a dimension-to-dimension analysis where you're using a fact table as your bridge.

32
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:57,470
This is another reason that you may need to use a bi-directional filter.

33
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:02,795
In general, one-to-many relationships moving in a single direction,

34
00:02:02,795 --> 00:02:05,030
are going to be our top choice.

35
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:07,760
I love them, and I think most people in

36
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,545
the Power BI community do because they're straightforward,

37
00:02:11,545 --> 00:02:14,375
they're easy to understand and follow,

38
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:17,870
which is true both for you as you're developing it and your

39
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:22,465
end-users when it comes to interpreting the reports correctly.

40
00:02:22,465 --> 00:02:27,980
They're predictable, so you know how the data is going to flow and how it's going to

41
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:33,980
perform based on different filters and measures built on top of the relationship.

42
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:37,555
As I mentioned, they play well with measures.

43
00:02:37,555 --> 00:02:43,685
Power BI also does you a favor by validating a one-to-many relationship and alerting

44
00:02:43,685 --> 00:02:49,640
you if it's not quite set up to provide the one-to-many relationship that you need,

45
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,685
something that doesn't always happen when you have, say,

46
00:02:52,685 --> 00:02:56,910
a many-to-many relationship that you're trying to set up instead.
