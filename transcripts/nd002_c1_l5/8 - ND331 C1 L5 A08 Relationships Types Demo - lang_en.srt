1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:05,415
Let's pick up from where we left off with our last demo,

2
00:00:05,415 --> 00:00:08,835
with the larger grocery store dataset this time.

3
00:00:08,835 --> 00:00:10,875
At the end of the last demo,

4
00:00:10,875 --> 00:00:14,835
we had each query complete but not yet loaded or connected.

5
00:00:14,835 --> 00:00:21,605
We also went through and we disabled loads for any of the queries that are

6
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:24,830
intermediary queries that we don't want showing up for

7
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:28,915
the reporting pane or the modeling pane.

8
00:00:28,915 --> 00:00:32,170
Let's go ahead and close and load.

9
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:41,285
Now, having closed the Power Query,

10
00:00:41,285 --> 00:00:43,925
we have our data loaded and we have

11
00:00:43,925 --> 00:00:47,840
a date table that we very carefully set up in the prior lesson.

12
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:56,270
Let's go ahead and go to our data pane or view as you may refer to it.

13
00:00:56,270 --> 00:01:01,245
I'm going to select this and I'm going to select mark as date table.

14
00:01:01,245 --> 00:01:03,935
Now, note right here that because I have,

15
00:01:03,935 --> 00:01:06,080
although date-time turned on,

16
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,750
it's giving me a little hierarchy that I could use if I wanted to,

17
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,740
but since we have a dedicated date table instead,

18
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:17,840
I'm going to make this our explicit date tables so we have more control.

19
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:21,720
Going to select "Date" as our date column.

20
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,705
Again, it is validated successfully.

21
00:01:24,705 --> 00:01:27,015
We'll go ahead and click this.

22
00:01:27,015 --> 00:01:28,280
As you can see right here,

23
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,830
it gives you a little note that says the built-in date tables,

24
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:32,840
that's this date hierarchy right here,

25
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,385
are going to be removed,

26
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:36,840
which is exactly what we want.

27
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:43,670
Now, this is set with a little icon here that

28
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:49,850
allows us to know that this is our designated date column and we're good to go.

29
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:54,660
Let's go back to our model view.

30
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,459
Just like we did with the smaller dataset,

31
00:01:58,459 --> 00:02:03,920
we're going to be creating relationships from our customer dimension,

32
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,310
product dimension, and date dimension to connect to our sales transactions.

33
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:17,990
The way that we'll do that is either by dragging and connecting to our customer ID.

34
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:20,710
So our two keys are connected.

35
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:24,920
Or by going up to manage relationships,

36
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:34,565
selecting new, and choosing each of our dimensions in turn,

37
00:02:34,565 --> 00:02:39,670
and connecting them to our sales transactions.

38
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:44,165
Now, here we have a one-to-one relationship.

39
00:02:44,165 --> 00:02:49,010
Power BI is assuming that we want a one-to-one relationship here,

40
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,690
and it's assuming wrong.

41
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:55,700
Let's go ahead and select many-to-one or rather one-to-many,

42
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:02,910
because many-to-one would suggest that the date dimension has many sales has one-to-many.

43
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:07,235
Cross filter direction we're going to make single.

44
00:03:07,235 --> 00:03:11,100
We're going to make this relationship active.

45
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:26,500
Let's try other detecting for the third and see how Power BI does.

46
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:30,010
Found one new relationship.

47
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,405
Let's select "Edit" and see what it shows for us.

48
00:03:34,405 --> 00:03:37,010
Sales transaction product ID,

49
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:39,305
product data, product ID,

50
00:03:39,305 --> 00:03:41,645
many dimension on the sales side,

51
00:03:41,645 --> 00:03:43,685
one dimension on the product side,

52
00:03:43,685 --> 00:03:45,875
cross filter direction is single.

53
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,875
It's gotten this one right.

54
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:51,620
Auto detect is a good option as a starting point,

55
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:56,480
but I would encourage you to never just use auto detect without

56
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:02,315
first checking because as we saw with this second relationship for date,

57
00:04:02,315 --> 00:04:07,650
Power BI sometimes guesses wrong, and sometimes spectacularly.

58
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,355
There we have our three-dimensions.

59
00:04:11,355 --> 00:04:15,470
Now, what would happen if I needed to change these for any reason?

60
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:19,960
Well, one, I can always hover over them to see what the relationships are,

61
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:24,905
and I can double-click and I can edit the relationship accordingly.

62
00:04:24,905 --> 00:04:30,125
Now, if hypothetically, I had named this very wrongly,

63
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:33,720
and preferred store was meant to be my relationship,

64
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:40,295
you can set up a relationship by adjusting it.

65
00:04:40,295 --> 00:04:42,350
If I wanted to use many-to-many,

66
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:44,705
which of course I do not.

67
00:04:44,705 --> 00:04:52,110
As you can see, it will allow me to create a relationship that is completely wrong.

68
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:02,665
There is no relationship between these two except through the Customer ID,

69
00:05:02,665 --> 00:05:04,025
but as you can see,

70
00:05:04,025 --> 00:05:07,890
it gives you a lot of flexibility to choose that nonetheless.

71
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:13,475
Last thing we should talk about is the cross filter direction.

72
00:05:13,475 --> 00:05:14,915
Most of the time we want single,

73
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:16,685
but if we need both,

74
00:05:16,685 --> 00:05:19,500
we can select it here.

75
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:30,470
Here we have three one-to-many relationships

76
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:35,260
going from the dimension to our fact table.

77
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:42,510
This is a tiny star telling you that there are many relationships in place.
